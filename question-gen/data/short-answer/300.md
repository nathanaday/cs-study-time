# Background

Arrange the following functions in ascending order of growth rate: $f_1(n) = n^{2.5}$, $f_2(n) = \sqrt{2n}$, $f_3(n) = n + 10$, $f_4(n) = 10^n$, $f_5(n) = 100^n$, $f_6(n) = n^2 \log n$.

# Parts

## a

List the functions in ascending order of growth rate.

**Answer:** $f_2(n) = \sqrt{2n}$, then $f_3(n) = n+10$, then $f_6(n) = n^2 \log n$, then $f_1(n) = n^{2.5}$, then $f_4(n) = 10^n$, then $f_5(n) = 100^n$. Key facts: $n^{1/2} \prec n \prec n^2 \log n \prec n^{2.5}$ (since $\log n = O(n^{0.5})$), and any polynomial is $O$ of any exponential, and $10^n = O(100^n)$ since $10 < 100$.

## b

Where does $g(n) = n^{\log n}$ fit among these functions?

**Answer:** Between $n^{2.5}$ and $10^n$. Taking logarithms: $\log(n^{\log n}) = (\log n)^2$ which grows faster than any constant times $\log n$ (ruling out any polynomial) but slower than $n$ (ruling out exponentials). So $n^{2.5} \prec n^{\log n} \prec 10^n$.
