# Background

Boxes arrive with weights $w_i$ and trucks have capacity $W$. A greedy algorithm packs boxes in arrival order and dispatches a truck when the next box won't fit.

## a

Prove using a 'staying ahead' argument that the greedy algorithm minimizes the number of trucks, given that boxes must ship in order.

**Answer:** Let $G$ use $k$ trucks and $O$ use $k'$ trucks. Claim: for each $j$, greedy's $j$-th truck carries at least as many boxes as $O$'s $j$-th truck. Base case: greedy packs as many boxes as possible on truck 1, so at least as many as $O$'s truck 1. Inductive step: if greedy's first $j-1$ trucks carry at least as many cumulative boxes, then greedy's $j$-th truck starts no later in the sequence and packs greedily, carrying at least as many. Since greedy stays ahead, it finishes in $\le k'$ trucks.
