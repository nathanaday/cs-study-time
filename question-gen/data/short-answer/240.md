# Background

A Maximum Spanning Tree is a spanning tree with maximum total weight.

# Parts

## a

Present an efficient algorithm to find a Maximum Spanning Tree of an undirected graph G.

**Answer:** Use a generalized Kruskal's algorithm: Sort all edges by their weights in non-increasing order. Initialize F as empty. For each edge (u,v) in sorted order: if length(u,v) > 0 and (u,v) does not create a cycle in F, add (u,v) to F. Time complexity is $O(|E| \log |V|)$, same as normal Kruskal's.

## b

Prove the correctness of your solution in part (a).

**Answer:** We need to show F is a maximum spanning tree: (1) F contains no cycle since we always check before adding. (2) F has maximum total weight. Proof: Let $F^*$ be a maximum forest. If $F = F^*$, done. Otherwise, there exists edge $e \in F^*$ not in $F$. Consider $F + e$; it contains a cycle $C$. Every other edge in $C$ has weight no less than $e$ (by our selection rule of picking heavier edges first). There is some edge $f$ in $C$ not in $F^*$. Let $F' = F + e - f$. Since $w(f) \geq w(e)$, we have $w(F') \leq w(F)$. Repeating this process transforms $F$ into $F^*$ without increasing weight, so $w(F) \geq w(F^*)$. Since $F^*$ is maximum, $F$ must also be maximum.
