# Background

Imagine you are driving on a k-lane highway. The route consists of points $p_0, \\ldots, p_n$, where $p_0$ is the starting point and $p_n$ is the ending point. You can switch lanes at any $p_i$ but must stick to a lane between $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$. Going from $p_i$ to $p_{i+1}$ in lane $j$ requires $T_{ij}$ minutes. Switching from lane $h$ to lane $j$ adds a delay of $2|h-j|$ minutes.

## a

Design an algorithm to compute the minimum possible travel time. For full credit, your algorithm should run asymptotically faster than $\Theta(n^2)$. Analyze its time complexity.

**Answer:** Create a grid-like graph. Each column $i$ has $k$ nodes corresponding to $k$ lanes at point $p_i$. Horizontal edges have weights $T_{ij}$ (travel time in lane $j$ from $p_i$ to $p_{i+1}$). Vertical edges between adjacent lanes have weight 2 (lane switching delay). Create node S connected to the leftmost column nodes with weight 0, and node T connected to the rightmost column nodes with weight 0. Compute the shortest S-T path using Dijkstra's algorithm. The graph has $O(nk)$ nodes and $O(nk)$ edges, so Dijkstra with a binary heap runs in $O(nk \log(nk))$ time.
