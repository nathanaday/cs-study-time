# Background

Consider performing MAX-HEAPIFY$(A, 3)$ on the array $A = \langle 27, 17, 3, 16, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12, 4, 8, 9, 0 \rangle$.

# Parts

## a

What is the final array after MAX-HEAPIFY$(A, 3)$ completes?

**Answer:** $[27, 17, 10, 16, 13, 9, 1, 5, 7, 12, 4, 8, 3, 0]$. First, $A[3]=3$ is swapped with $A[6]=10$ (largest child). Then at index 6, $A[6]=3$ is swapped with $A[13]=9$ (largest child). Index 13 is a leaf, so the procedure terminates.

## b

How many swaps does MAX-HEAPIFY perform in this case, and what is the height of the subtree rooted at index 3?

**Answer:** 2 swaps are performed. The subtree rooted at index 3 has height 3 (levels: index 3, then 6/7, then 12/13/14, then potentially children of those). The element sinks 2 levels out of a possible 3.
