# Background

Suppose you have two min-heaps, A and B, with a total of $n$ elements between them. You want to discover if A and B have a key in common. For this problem, do not use the fact that heaps are implemented as arrays; treat them as abstract data types.

# Parts

## a

Give a solution to this problem that takes time $O(n \log n)$ and explain why it is correct and has the required running time.

**Answer:** Compare the top (minimum) elements of A and B. If they are equal, we found a common key. If the top of A is smaller, extract the minimum from A (removing it). If the top of B is smaller, extract the minimum from B. Repeat until either a common key is found or one heap is empty. Correctness: by always removing the smaller of the two minimums, we process elements in globally sorted order. If a common key exists, both copies will eventually be at the tops of their respective heaps simultaneously. Runtime: each iteration performs at most two extract-min operations at cost $O(\log n)$ each, and there are at most $O(n)$ iterations (each removes one element), giving $O(n \log n)$ total.
