## a

Suppose we perform a sequence of $n$ operations on a data structure in which the $i$-th operation costs $i$ if $i$ is an exact power of 2, and costs 1 otherwise. Use aggregate analysis to determine the amortized cost per operation.

**Answer:** In a sequence of $n$ operations, there are $\lfloor \log n \rfloor + 1$ exact powers of 2, namely $1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{\lfloor \log n \rfloor}$. The total cost of these expensive operations is at most $1 + 2 + 4 + \ldots + 2^{\lfloor \log n \rfloor} \leq 2n$. The remaining operations each cost 1, totaling at most $n$. Thus total cost $T(n) \leq 2n + n = 3n$, which means the amortized cost per operation is $O(3) = O(1)$.
