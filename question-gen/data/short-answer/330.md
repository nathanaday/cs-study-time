# Background

A directed graph has time-dependent travel: edge $e = (v,w)$ has arrival-time function $f_e(t)$ that is monotone increasing with $f_e(t) \ge t$. You want the fastest route from source to destination starting at time 0.

# Parts

## a

How can Dijkstra's algorithm be adapted for this setting?

**Answer:** Use arrival times instead of distances. Initialize arrival[source] = 0, all others $\infty$. Use a priority queue keyed by arrival time. When extracting node $u$, for each edge $(u,w)$: compute new_arrival $= f_e(\text{arrival}[u])$; if new_arrival $<$ arrival[$w$], update. This works because monotonicity of $f_e$ ensures Dijkstra's greedy property: once a node's arrival time is finalized, no future path can improve it.

## b

Why does the monotonicity of $f_e(t)$ ensure correctness of the greedy approach?

**Answer:** Monotonicity means arriving at $u$ later can only result in arriving at $w$ later (or at the same time). So all unfinalized nodes have arrival times $\ge$ the current minimum, and routing through them can only increase arrival times at their neighbors. This preserves Dijkstra's key invariant: the node with minimum tentative arrival time has its true optimal arrival time.
