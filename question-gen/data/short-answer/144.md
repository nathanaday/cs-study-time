# Background

Given a positive integer $n$, we would like to find non-negative integers $x, y, z, w$ such that $n = 15x + 10y + 5z + w$ and $x + y + z + w$ is minimum possible.

# Parts

## a

Show that in an optimal solution where $x + y + z + w$ is minimum, we must have $w < 5$, $z < 2$, and $y < 3$.

**Answer:** If $w \geq 5$, replace $(x, y, z, w)$ with $(x, y, z+1, w-5)$: the sum $n$ is unchanged but $x+y+z+w$ decreases by 4. If $z \geq 2$, replace with $(x, y+1, z-2, w)$: sum unchanged, total decreases by 1. If $y \geq 3$, replace with $(x+2, y-3, z, w)$: $15(x+2)+10(y-3) = 15x+30+10y-30 = 15x+10y$, sum unchanged, total decreases by 1. Each contradicts optimality.

## b

Give an efficient algorithm that finds an optimal solution, and justify its running time.

**Answer:** From part (a), $y^* \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, $z^* \in \{0, 1\}$, $w^* \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$. Iterate over all $(y, z, w) \in \{0,1,2\} \times \{0,1\} \times \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ (at most 30 combinations). For each, compute $x = (n - 10y - 5z - w)/15$. If $x \geq 0$ and $(n - 10y - 5z - w) \mod 15 = 0$, compute $x + y + z + w$ and track the minimum. The runtime is $O(1)$ since the number of combinations is constant.
