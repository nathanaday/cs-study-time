# Background

Assume the coastline of the country Lyniera is an infinite straight line. There are islands off the coastline. The king decided to set up radar bases along the coastline. Each radar base can cover a circular area of radius $d$. Each island is a point in the sea with coordinates $(x, y)$. Assume each island is within distance $d$ of the coast.

## a

Design a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of radar bases needed to cover all the islands and give their locations on the coastline. Prove the correctness of your algorithm.

**Answer:** For each island, draw a circle of radius $d$ around it and compute the interval on the x-axis where a radar base could cover this island. This transforms the problem into finding the minimum number of points covering all intervals.

Greedy strategy: Place a radar base at the right-most point of the interval with the smallest right endpoint that has not been covered yet. Remove all intervals containing this point. Repeat until all intervals are covered.

Proof: Let the leftmost radar base in the optimal solution $S^*$ be at $r^*$. Our greedy places a base at $r$ where $r \geq r^*$ (at the rightmost point of the interval with smallest right endpoint). Since $r \geq r^*$, every island covered by $r^*$ is also covered by $r$. So we can replace $r^*$ with $r$ and still have an optimal solution. By induction on subsequent bases, the greedy solution is optimal.
