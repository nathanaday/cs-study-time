# Background

Consider a long, quiet country road with houses scattered sparsely along it (modeled as a line segment with eastern and western endpoints). You want to place cell phone base stations at certain points along the road so that every house is within four miles of one of the base stations.

# Parts

## a

Give an efficient algorithm that places as few base stations as possible. Prove that your algorithm correctly minimizes the number of base stations.

**Answer:** Algorithm: Find the first (leftmost) uncovered house. Place a base station 4 miles to its right. Eliminate all houses covered by this station (within 4 miles). Repeat until all houses are covered. Proof (by induction): Our base stations are always to the right of (or not to the left of) the corresponding base stations in any optimal solution. Base case: our first station is as far right as possible while still covering the leftmost house, so the optimal first station cannot be further right. Inductive step: assuming our $k$-th station is at least as far right as the optimal $k$-th station, the first uncovered house for both solutions must be at or to the right of our $k$-th station's coverage, so our $(k+1)$-th station is again at least as far right. Since our stations are never behind the optimal ones, if the optimal uses fewer stations, its last station cannot cover a house that triggered our additional station -- contradiction. Time complexity: $O(n \log n)$ for sorting houses by position, plus $O(n)$ for the greedy pass.
