# Background

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we are interested in finding the longest simple path that visits all vertices (a Hamiltonian path), if one exists.

# Parts

## a

Give a linear-time algorithm to determine if there is a simple path in a DAG that visits all vertices.

**Answer:** Find a topological ordering of the DAG. Then check if there is an edge between each consecutive pair of vertices in that topological order (i.e., from vertex at position $i$ to vertex at position $i+1$ for all $i$). If all such edges exist, this topological order gives a Hamiltonian path. If any consecutive edge is missing, no Hamiltonian path exists. This works because if a Hamiltonian path exists, it defines a strict precedence order from start to end, meaning the DAG has a unique topological ordering. If our topological order does not provide such a path, then no Hamiltonian path exists. Computing the topological order takes $O(|V| + |E|)$ and checking consecutive edges takes $O(|V|)$.
