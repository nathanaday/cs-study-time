# Background

There are $n$ jobs with processing time $t_i$ and weight $w_i$. Job $i$ finishes at its completion time $C_i$. The goal is to minimize $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i C_i$.

# Parts

## a

What is the optimal scheduling rule?

**Answer:** Schedule jobs in decreasing order of $w_i/t_i$ (weight-to-processing-time ratio).

## b

Prove this using an exchange argument on adjacent jobs $i$ and $j$.

**Answer:** For adjacent jobs $i,j$ starting at time $T$: order $(i,j)$ contributes $w_i(T+t_i) + w_j(T+t_i+t_j)$; order $(j,i)$ contributes $w_j(T+t_j) + w_i(T+t_j+t_i)$. The difference is $w_jt_i - w_it_j$. Order $(i,j)$ is better when $w_jt_i < w_it_j$, i.e., $w_i/t_i > w_j/t_j$. So placing the higher-ratio job first is always better.
