# Background

Consider the following code segment:

void bigOh1(int[] L, int n)
    while (n > 0)
        find_max(L, n);  // finds the max in L[0...n-1], takes O(n) time
        n = n/4;

## a

Find an upper bound (Big O) on the worst case runtime. Then determine if this is a tight upper bound (Big Theta).

**Answer:** The while loop runs $\log_4 n$ iterations. A naive analysis gives $O(n \log n)$. But summing the actual cost of find_max at each iteration: $cn + cn/4 + cn/16 + \ldots$ This is a geometric series with ratio $1/4$, which sums to less than $cn \cdot \frac{1}{1 - 1/4} = \frac{4cn}{3} < 2cn$. So the total work is $O(n)$, not $O(n \log n)$. The $O(n \log n)$ bound is not tight. The tight bound is $\Theta(n)$.
