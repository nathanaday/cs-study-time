# Background

A near-tree is a connected graph with at most $n+8$ edges (at most 9 extra edges beyond a spanning tree).

# Parts

## a

Give an $O(n)$ algorithm to find the MST of a near-tree.

**Answer:** Find any spanning tree $T$ using DFS in $O(n+m) = O(n)$ time (since $m \le n+8$). There are at most 9 non-tree edges. For each non-tree edge $e = (u,v)$, adding $e$ to $T$ creates a cycle. Find the most expensive edge on this cycle (path from $u$ to $v$ in $T$ plus $e$). If $e$ is cheaper, swap them. Each cycle check takes $O(n)$ and there are at most 9, so total extra work is $O(9 \cdot n) = O(n)$.
