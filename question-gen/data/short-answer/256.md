# Background

Consider a list data structure that has the following operations defined on it:\n- Append(x): Adds the element x to the end of the list (cost 1)\n- DeleteFourth(): Removes every fourth element in the list, i.e. removes the first, fifth, ninth, etc., elements of the list (cost equals the number of elements in the list)

What is the amortized cost of Append and DeleteFourth operations? Consider the worst sequence of operations. Justify your answer using the accounting method.

**Answer:** Append gets charged 5 tokens. When we call Append, we spend 1 token immediately to pay for the cost of the call, then store the remaining 4 tokens with the item added to the list. When we call DeleteFourth(), every element in the list has 4 tokens stored with it. We take the 4 tokens from each deleted item to pay for the cost of DeleteFourth(). We can do this since n/4 items are deleted and so there are n tokens on these deleted items (4 tokens each times n/4 items = n tokens, which covers the cost n). At the end, all remaining elements still have 4 tokens. The amortized cost per operation is thus O(1).
