## a

In an instance of the Stable Matching problem, man m has claimed he will marry woman w in every stable matching. Design an $O(n^2)$ algorithm that, given an instance of Stable Matching as well as man m and woman w, checks whether m marries w in every stable matching or not.

**Answer:** Run the Gale-Shapley algorithm twice: once with men proposing and once with women proposing. In the first execution, we learn whom is the best woman that m can hope to marry in a stable matching. In the second execution, we see whom is the worst woman he may ever marry. If both matchings pair m with w, it means w is both m's best and worst valid partner, so m must marry w in every stable matching. Otherwise, there exists a stable matching where m does not marry w. The complexity is $O(2 \cdot n^2) = O(n^2)$.
