# Background

Given an array of distinct integers $A = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]$ and a sequence $p = [1, 2, \ldots, n]$, you may rearrange the numbers in $p$ to minimize $\sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - p_i|$.

# Parts

## a

Design a greedy algorithm that minimizes $\sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - p_i|$. Prove its correctness and analyze its running time.

**Answer:** Sort $A$ in increasing order and assign the values of $p$ in increasing order accordingly. That is, the position that holds the smallest $a_i$ gets $p_i = 1$, the next smallest gets $p_i = 2$, and so on. Proof by exchange argument: Consider two indices $i, j$ with $a_i < a_j$ and $p_i < p_j$. If we swap to get $p_i > p_j$, then $|a_i - p_j| + |a_j - p_i| \geq |a_i - p_i| + |a_j - p_j|$ by the rearrangement inequality (matching sorted orders minimizes total absolute deviation). For any pair where $a_i < a_j$ but $p_i > p_j$, swapping $p_i$ and $p_j$ does not increase the total cost. Removing all inversions gives both sequences sorted. Time complexity: $O(n \log n)$ for sorting.
