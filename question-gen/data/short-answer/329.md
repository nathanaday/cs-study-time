# Background

Sensitive processes run during intervals $[s_i, f_i]$. You must invoke status_check at as few times as possible such that each process is checked at least once (a check at time $t$ covers process $i$ if $s_i \le t \le f_i$).

# Parts

## a

Describe the greedy algorithm and its proof of optimality.

**Answer:** Sort processes by finish time $f_i$. For each uncovered process (in order), invoke status_check at time $f_i$ and mark all processes containing $f_i$ as covered. This is optimal because each check time corresponds to a process not covered by any previous check, and these 'triggering' processes are pairwise non-overlapping.

## b

If $k^*$ is the maximum number of pairwise non-overlapping processes, prove that $k^*$ checks suffice.

**Answer:** The greedy algorithm produces exactly $k^*$ checks. Each check is triggered by a process that doesn't overlap with any previously triggering process (otherwise it would have been covered). So the triggering processes form a set of $k^*$ pairwise non-overlapping processes. Conversely, each non-overlapping process needs its own check. Thus min checks $= k^* =$ max non-overlapping processes (a min-max duality).
