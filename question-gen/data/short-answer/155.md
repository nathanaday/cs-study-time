# Background

Given an unsorted array of size $n$, you want to find the $k$-th largest element.

# Parts

## a

Devise a heap-based algorithm that finds the $k$-th largest element. What is its runtime complexity?

**Answer:** Build a max-heap from the array in $O(n)$ time. Then perform $k$ extract-max operations, each costing $O(\log n)$. The $k$-th extracted element is the $k$-th largest. The overall complexity is $O(n + k \log n)$.
