# Background

Suppose you have a stable matching problem with n men and n women. You know all the preferences using which you run the G-S algorithm (with men proposing) to compute a stable matching. You also note down the number of times each man is rejected. Later, when you want to use the stable matching you computed, you realize that it is lost, and you have also lost some of the women's preference lists. Thus, all you are left with is: 1) all of the men's preference lists, 2) some but not all of the women's preference lists, 3) the number of rejections ($r_i$ for each man $i$).

# Parts

## a

Devise an algorithm (with explanation and time complexity) to find a stable matching from the information available, or prove that it is not possible to compute one using the information available.

**Answer:** In G-S, men propose in decreasing order of their respective preferences. Since man $i$ was rejected $r_i$ times, he was matched with the $(r_i + 1)$-th woman on his preference list. All of this information is available from the men's preference lists and the rejection counts, giving us a linear time algorithm. We do not need any of the women's preference lists.
