# Background

Mathematicians track a statistic called their Erdos Number. Paul Erdos himself has a number of zero. Anyone who wrote a mathematical paper with him has a number of one, anyone who wrote a paper with someone who wrote a paper with him has a number of two, and so forth. Suppose we have a database of all mathematical papers ever written along with their authors.

# Parts

## a

Explain how to represent this data as a graph.

**Answer:** Create a graph where nodes represent mathematicians and edges represent co-authorship (two mathematicians share an edge if they co-authored a paper).

## b

Explain how we would compute the Erdos number for a particular researcher.

**Answer:** Run BFS in the co-authorship graph starting from the Erdos node. The level (distance) at which a particular mathematician appears in the BFS tree is their Erdos number.

## c

Explain how we would determine all researchers with Erdos number at most two.

**Answer:** Run BFS starting from the Erdos node. All mathematicians within the first 2 levels of the BFS tree (distance at most 2 from Erdos) have Erdos numbers of at most two.
