## a

Given an $n \times n$ matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the $k$-th smallest element in the matrix using a heap. You may assume that $k < n$. Your algorithm must run in time strictly better than $O(n^2)$.

**Answer:** Solution: 1) Build a min-heap containing the first element of each row ($n$ elements), taking $O(n)$ time. 2) Run deleteMin to return the smallest element. If the element from the $i$-th row was deleted, insert the next remaining element in the same row to the min-heap. 3) Repeat step 2 a total of $k$ times. The $k$-th deleteMin gives the answer.

Runtime: Min-heap is built in $O(n)$. Since there are $n$ elements in the heap, each deleteMin takes $O(\log n)$. We perform $k-1$ delete-and-insert operations. Total: $O(n + k \log n)$. Since $k < n$, this is $O(n \log n)$ which is strictly better than $O(n^2)$.
