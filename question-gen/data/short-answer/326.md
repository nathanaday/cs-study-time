# Background

A mini-triathlon has swimming (pool, one at a time), biking, and running (simultaneously after exiting the pool). Contestant $i$ has swim time $s_i$, bike time $b_i$, and run time $r_i$.

# Parts

## a

What ordering of contestants minimizes the total completion time, and why?

**Answer:** Sort contestants in decreasing order of $b_i + r_i$ (post-swim time). The pool is the serial bottleneck. Contestants with the longest post-swim activities should swim first so their biking and running overlap with others' swimming.

## b

Prove this is optimal using an exchange argument on two adjacent contestants.

**Answer:** For adjacent contestants $i,j$ starting swim at time $T_0$: order $(i,j)$ finishes at $\max(T_0+s_i+b_i+r_i, T_0+s_i+s_j+b_j+r_j)$; order $(j,i)$ finishes at $\max(T_0+s_j+b_j+r_j, T_0+s_j+s_i+b_i+r_i)$. If $b_j+r_j > b_i+r_i$, the order $(j,i)$ (larger post-swim first) gives a smaller or equal maximum. So sorting by decreasing $b_i+r_i$ is optimal.
