# Background

Solve the following recurrences using the Master Method. You do not need to justify your answers, but any justification will help when assigning partial credit.

# Parts

## i

$T(n) = 8T(n/2) + n \log n$

**Answer:** Case 1 of the Master Method: $a = 8, b = 2$, so $n^{\log_b a} = n^3$. Since $f(n) = n \log n = O(n^{3-\epsilon})$ for $\epsilon = 1$, $T(n) = \Theta(n^3)$.

## ii

$T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^2 (\log n)^2$

**Answer:** Case 2 of the Master Method: $a = 4, b = 2$, so $n^{\log_b a} = n^2$. Since $f(n) = n^2 (\log n)^2 = \Theta(n^2 \log^k n)$ with $k = 2$, $T(n) = \Theta(n^2 (\log n)^3)$.

## iii

$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n^3 (\log n)^3$

**Answer:** Case 3 of the Master Method: $a = 2, b = 2$, so $n^{\log_b a} = n$. Since $f(n) = n^3 (\log n)^3 = \Omega(n^{1+\epsilon})$ for $\epsilon = 1$, check regularity: $2f(n/2) = 2(n/2)^3 (\log(n/2))^3 \leq c \cdot n^3 (\log n)^3$ for $c = 1/4 < 1$. So $T(n) = \Theta(n^3 (\log n)^3)$.
