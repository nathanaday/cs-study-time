# Background

For each part below, solve the recurrence using the Master Method -- if it applies -- by giving tight theta-notation bound and briefly showing the steps. If the Master Method does not apply, explain why (no need to solve the recurrence in that case). Here, T(.) represents the running time of an algorithm.

# Parts

## a

$T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^2 \log^2 n$

**Answer:** Second case of Master Theorem: $a=4, b=2, n^{\log_b a} = n^2$. Since $f(n) = n^2 \log^2 n = \Theta(n^2 \log^k n)$ with $k=2$, we get $T(n) = \Theta(n^2 \log^3 n)$.

## b

$T(n) = 100^{100} T(n/2) + 3^n$

**Answer:** Third case: $a = 100^{100}, b = 2$. $n^{\log_b a} = n^{100 \cdot \log_2 100}$ which is polynomial. Since $f(n) = 3^n$ is exponential and dominates any polynomial, $f(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})$. Regularity condition: $100^{100} \cdot 3^{n/2} \leq c \cdot 3^n$ for some $c < 1$ and large $n$. This holds since $3^{n/2}$ grows past any constant. $T(n) = \Theta(3^n)$.

## c

$T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/4) + n$

**Answer:** Master Theorem does not apply because the recurrence must have a single term of the form $aT(n/b)$. This recurrence has two recursive terms with different subproblem sizes ($n/2$ and $n/4$).

## d

$T(n) = \frac{1}{2} T(n/2) + n$

**Answer:** Master Theorem does not apply because $a = 1/2 < 1$. The Master Theorem requires $a \geq 1$ (the number of subproblems must be at least 1 as a positive integer).
