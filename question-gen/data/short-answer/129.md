# Background

Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected, unweighted graph, and let $e \in E$ be a specified edge.

Design an algorithm that determines whether there exists a cycle in $G$ that contains the edge $e$. Your algorithm must run in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time. Describe the algorithm, justify its correctness, and analyze its running time.

**Answer:** Let $e = (u, v)$. Remove $e$ from $G$ to obtain $G' = (V, E \setminus \{e\})$. Run BFS or DFS from $u$ in $G'$. If $v$ is reachable from $u$ in $G'$, then there exists a path from $u$ to $v$ not using $e$. Adding $e$ back forms a cycle containing $e$. If $v$ is not reachable, then removing $e$ disconnects $u$ and $v$, so $e$ cannot be part of any cycle. The BFS/DFS takes $O(|V| + |E|)$ time, and removing the edge takes constant time, so the overall runtime is $O(|V| + |E|)$.
