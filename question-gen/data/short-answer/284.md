# Background

Consider running BUILD-MAX-HEAP on the array $A = \langle 5, 3, 17, 10, 84, 19, 6, 22, 9 \rangle$.

# Parts

## a

At which index does the loop in BUILD-MAX-HEAP begin, and why does it skip higher indices?

**Answer:** The loop begins at index $\lfloor 9/2 \rfloor = 4$. Indices 5 through 9 are skipped because they are leaves (they have no children), and leaves are trivially valid max-heaps of size 1.

## b

What is the final array after BUILD-MAX-HEAP completes?

**Answer:** $[84, 22, 19, 10, 3, 17, 6, 5, 9]$. The procedure processes $i=4$ (swap 10 with 22), $i=3$ (swap 17 with 19), $i=2$ (swap 3 with 84, then 3 is a leaf), $i=1$ (swap 5 with 84, then swap 5 with 22, then swap 5 with 10).
