# Background

The values 1, 2, 3, ..., 63 are all inserted (in any order) into an initially empty min-heap.

What is the smallest number that could be a leaf node?

**Answer:** Since there are $2^6 - 1 = 63$ elements, the heap forms a full binary tree with 6 levels (levels 0 through 5). In a min-heap, any node must be smaller than all its descendants. A node at level $k$ has at least $k$ ancestors (including itself on the path from root), all of which must be smaller. The root is 1 (the minimum). For a leaf at level 5, only the 5 nodes on the path from root to that leaf must be ordered. The smallest possible leaf value is 6: place values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 along one root-to-leaf path, and 6 becomes the leaf at depth 5 of that path. Any value smaller than 6 would need to be an internal node (since there are only 5 ancestor slots). So the answer is 6.
