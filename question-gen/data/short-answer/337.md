# Background

You have $n$ bank cards. Two cards are equivalent if they correspond to the same account. You can test equivalence of any two cards. You want to determine whether more than $n/2$ cards are equivalent.

# Parts

## a

Describe a divide-and-conquer algorithm using $O(n \log n)$ equivalence tests.

**Answer:** Recursively find majority candidates in each half. If a majority exists in the full set, it must be a majority in at least one half. So at most two candidates emerge. For each non-null candidate, scan all $n$ cards and count equivalences. If a candidate matches $> n/2$ cards, return it. Recurrence: $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) = O(n \log n)$.

## b

Why must the majority element (if it exists) be a majority in at least one of the two halves?

**Answer:** If a card type appears $> n/2$ times overall, distribute these copies across the two halves (each of size $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ and $\lceil n/2 \rceil$). If it were not a majority in either half, it would appear $\le \lfloor n/2 \rfloor / 2$ times in each, totaling $\le n/2$, contradicting that it appears $> n/2$ times.
