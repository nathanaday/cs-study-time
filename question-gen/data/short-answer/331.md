# Background

Given a connected graph $G$ with distinct edge bandwidths $b_e$, you want a spanning tree $T$ such that for every pair $u,v$, the bottleneck bandwidth of the $u$-$v$ path in $T$ equals the best achievable bottleneck bandwidth in all of $G$.

# Parts

## a

Which spanning tree achieves this property, and what algorithm finds it?

**Answer:** The maximum spanning tree. Run Kruskal's algorithm in decreasing order of bandwidth (or negate bandwidths and find the MST). For any pair $u,v$, the path in the maximum spanning tree achieves the best possible bottleneck bandwidth.

## b

Explain why no path in $G$ can have a better bottleneck than the maximum spanning tree path.

**Answer:** For any edge $e$ on the $u$-$v$ path in the max spanning tree $T$, removing $e$ splits $T$ into two components. By the cut property for max spanning trees, $e$ is the maximum-bandwidth edge crossing this cut. So $e$'s bandwidth is at least as large as any alternative crossing edge. Any $u$-$v$ path must cross this cut, so its bottleneck cannot exceed the bottleneck of the tree path.
