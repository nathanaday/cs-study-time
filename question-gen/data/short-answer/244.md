# Background

A directed graph G is given with edge costs marked on each edge. Vertices are {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} with edges: a->b(10), a->c(2), c->b(5), c->d(0), c->e(3), d->b(2), d->g(0), e->g(2), g->f(1).

# Parts

## a

Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from node a to all nodes that can be reached from a. List all shortest paths in the order they are found.

**Answer:** Starting from a (dist=0):
1. a->c (dist=2)
2. a->c->d (dist=2)
3. a->c->d->g (dist=2)
4. a->c->d->g->f (dist=3)
5. a->c->d->b (dist=4) [shorter than a->b=10 and a->c->b=7 and a->c->e->...]

Note: a->c->e (dist=5) is also discovered but b is reached first via d.
