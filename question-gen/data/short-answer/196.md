# Background

Suppose we have a graph G with positive edge-weights and an MST T. Each of the parts below describes how G is modified. In each case, either prove that T still remains an MST of the modified graph, or provide an algorithm that computes a new MST -- this algorithm should be asymptotically faster than computing an MST of G from scratch.

# Parts

## a

10 arbitrary edges from T are chosen and their weights are halved.

**Answer:** MST remains the same. Before the change, adding any non-tree edge to T creates a cycle where the non-tree edge is at least as heavy as the others in the cycle. Halving a tree edge only makes it lighter, so it remains the lightest in any cycle it participates in. The same argument applies after the change.

## b

10 arbitrary edges not in T are chosen and their weights are halved.

**Answer:** Each modified (halved) edge has potential to replace an existing edge of the MST. Algorithm: For each modified edge (u,v), run BFS/DFS in T to find the unique path P from u to v. Find the largest edge e on P. If e has higher weight than the new weight of (u,v), replace e with (u,v). Each inner loop runs in linear time, so for 10 edges the total is O(n).

## c

10 arbitrary edges from T are chosen and their weights are doubled.

**Answer:** Each doubled edge may need to be replaced. For each doubled tree edge (u,v), remove it from T to get two components. Find the lightest non-tree edge crossing the cut. If its weight is less than the doubled weight, replace (u,v). This runs in O(n) per edge, O(n) total for 10 edges.

## d

10 arbitrary edges not in T are chosen and their weights are doubled.

**Answer:** MST remains the same. Before the change, each non-tree edge was at least as heavy as every tree edge on the corresponding cycle path. Doubling a non-tree edge only makes it heavier, so it still cannot replace any tree edge. T remains an MST.
