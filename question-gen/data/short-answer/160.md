# Background

Given the sequence of numbers: 3, 5, 2, 8, 1, 5, 2, 7.

# Parts

## a

Draw a binomial heap by inserting the above numbers from left to right. Describe the structure of the resulting binomial heap.

**Answer:** After inserting all 8 elements, we get a binomial heap with a single binomial tree $B_3$ (since $8 = 2^3$). The root is 1 (the minimum). Its children are binomial trees $B_2$, $B_1$, and $B_0$. The tree structure: Root 1 has children 2, 2, and 5. The left child 2 has children 3 and 8. Node 3 has child 5. The middle child 2 has child 7.

## b

Show the resulting binomial heap after calling deleteMin() on the heap from part (a).

**Answer:** deleteMin removes the root (1), producing its three children as separate binomial trees: $B_2$ rooted at 2 (with children 3 and 8, where 3 has child 5), $B_1$ rooted at 2 (with child 7), and $B_0$ which is the single node 5. We then merge these three trees using binomial heap merge. The two $B_0$ trees (5 and the one split off) merge, and cascading merges produce the final heap. Result: $B_0$ = {5}, $B_1$ = {2, 7}, $B_2$ = {2, 3, 8, 5} where 2 is root with children 7 and 2, and the structure preserves heap order.
