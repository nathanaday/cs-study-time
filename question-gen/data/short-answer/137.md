# Background

A directed graph $G = (V, E)$ is singly connected if $G$ contains at most one simple path from $u$ to $v$ for all vertices $u, v \in V$.

# Parts

## a

Construct an algorithm using DFS to determine whether or not a directed graph is singly connected. Determine the time complexity and justify your answer.

**Answer:** Run a DFS starting from each vertex in the graph. During each DFS, maintain a visited array that marks vertices as they are first discovered. When exploring an edge $(u, v)$, if $v$ has already been visited and $v$ is not the parent of $u$ in the DFS tree, then there exist at least two distinct paths between some pair of vertices, so the graph is not singly connected. If for every DFS run, the only previously visited vertex encountered from any node is its parent in the DFS tree, then no alternate paths exist and the graph is singly connected. Time complexity: $O(|V|(|V| + |E|))$, since each DFS takes $O(|V| + |E|)$ time and we perform DFS from each of the $O(|V|)$ vertices.
