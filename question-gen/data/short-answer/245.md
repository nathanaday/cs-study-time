# Background

Given an array of $n$ distinct integers sorted in ascending order, we are interested in finding a Fixed Point. A Fixed Point is an index $i$ such that arr[$i$] = $i$. Note that integers can be negative. Example: arr[] = {-10, -5, 0, 3, 7}, Output: 3 since arr[3] = 3.

# Parts

## a

Present an algorithm that returns a Fixed Point if there are any present in the array, else returns -1. Your algorithm should run in $O(\log n)$ in the worst case.

**Answer:** Use binary search. Check whether the middle element is a Fixed Point (arr[mid] == mid). If it is, return it. Otherwise, if arr[mid] > mid, the Fixed Point (if any) lies on the left side (since the array is sorted with distinct values, all elements to the right will also be too large). If arr[mid] < mid, the Fixed Point lies on the right side. If subproblem size equals 1 and it's not a Fixed Point, return -1.

## b

Use the Master Method to verify that your solution runs in $O(\log n)$ time.

**Answer:** $a = 1, b = 2, f(n) = O(1)$. $n^{\log_b a} = n^{\log_2 1} = n^0 = 1 = O(1)$. This is Case 2 of the Master Theorem with $k = 0$: $T(n) = \Theta(\log n)$.

## c

Say you have found a Fixed Point P. Provide an algorithm that determines whether P is a unique Fixed Point. Your algorithm should run in $O(1)$ in the worst case.

**Answer:** Say the Fixed Point is found at index $i$ (arr[$i$] = $i$). Check indices $i+1$ and $i-1$. If neither is a Fixed Point, then P is unique. This works because the array is sorted with distinct integers: if arr[$i+1$] $\neq i+1$ and arr[$i-1$] $\neq i-1$, then for all $j > i$, arr[$j$] > $j$ (since distinct sorted values increase by at least 1 per index), and for all $j < i$, arr[$j$] < $j$. This takes $O(1)$ time.
