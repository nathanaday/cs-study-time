# Background

An $n \times n$ grid graph has each node labeled with a distinct real number. A local minimum is a node whose label is smaller than all its grid neighbors (up to 4).

# Parts

## a

Describe a divide-and-conquer algorithm that finds a local minimum using only $O(n)$ probes (not $O(n^2)$).

**Answer:** Probe all nodes in the middle row and middle column (a cross shape, $O(n)$ probes). Find the global minimum $m$ among probed nodes. Probe $m$'s grid neighbors. If $m$ is a local minimum, return it. Otherwise, a neighbor $m'$ with smaller value lies in one of the four quadrants. Recurse on that quadrant.

## b

Prove the recurrence is $T(n) = T(n/2) + O(n)$, yielding $O(n)$ total probes.

**Answer:** Each level probes $O(n)$ nodes (one row + one column of the current subgrid). The quadrant has dimensions $n/2 \times n/2$, so the next level probes $O(n/2)$ nodes. The recurrence $T(n) = T(n/2) + O(n)$ solves to $T(n) = O(n) + O(n/2) + O(n/4) + \cdots = O(n)$ by the geometric series.
