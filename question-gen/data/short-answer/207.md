Prove or disprove: For a given stable matching problem, if m and w appear as a pair when men propose and they also appear as a pair when women propose, then m and w must be paired in all possible stable matchings.

**Answer:** True. Let S denote the stable matching from men proposing and S_0 from women proposing. In S, every woman is paired with her worst valid partner. In S_0, every woman is paired with her best valid partner. Since in both S and S_0, w is paired with m, it follows that for w the best valid partner and worst valid partner are the same (m). This implies w has a unique valid partner (m), which means m and w are paired together in all stable matchings.
