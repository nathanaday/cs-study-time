# Background

Solve the following recurrence equations by giving tight theta-notation bounds in terms of n for sufficiently large n. Here, T(.) represents the running time of an algorithm. For each part, either use the Master Method if it directly applies and clearly show which case applies and why, or explain why the Master Method does not apply and solve using the brute force method.

# Parts

## a

$T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^2 \log n$

**Answer:** Case 2 of the Master Theorem applies. $a=4, b=2$, so $n^{\log_b a} = n^2$. Since $f(n) = n^2 \log n = \Theta(n^2 \log^k n)$ with $k=1$, we get $T(n) = \Theta(n^2 \log^2 n)$.

## b

$T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/4) + n^2$

**Answer:** Master Theorem does not apply because the recurrence has two recursive terms with different subproblem sizes. Using recursion tree: cost at level 0 is $cn^2$, level 1 is $5/16 \cdot cn^2$, level 2 is $25/256 \cdot cn^2$. The ratio is $5/16 < 1$, so the geometric series converges. Total cost is $\Theta(n^2)$.

## c

$T(n) = 16T(n/2) + 2^n$

**Answer:** Case 3 of the Master Theorem. $a=16, b=2$, so $n^{\log_b a} = n^4$. Since $f(n) = 2^n$ grows exponentially and is $\Omega(n^{4+\epsilon})$, and the regularity condition holds ($16 \cdot f(n/2) = 16 \cdot 2^{n/2} \leq c \cdot 2^n$ for $c = 8/2^{n/2}$ which goes to 0), we get $T(n) = \Theta(2^n)$.
