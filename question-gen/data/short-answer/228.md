Design an algorithm which, given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and a particular edge $e \in E$, determines whether G has a cycle containing $e$. The running time should be bounded by $O(|V| + |E|)$. Explain why your algorithm runs in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time.

**Answer:** Let $s$ and $t$ denote the endpoints of edge $e$. Delete $e$ from $G$ to obtain a new graph $G'$. Run DFS or BFS from $s$ in $G'$. If $t$ can be reached, then $G$ has a cycle containing $e$ (the path from $s$ to $t$ in $G'$ plus the edge $e$ forms a cycle). Otherwise, $G$ does not have such a cycle. DFS/BFS runs in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time since it visits each vertex and edge at most once.
