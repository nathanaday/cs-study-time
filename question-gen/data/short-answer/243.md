# Background

The Fractional Knapsack problem: We have a knapsack with capacity W. There are n items, each with weight $w_i$ and value $v_i$. You are allowed to put any fraction of an item into the knapsack. The goal is to maximize total value subject to the capacity constraint.

# Parts

## a

Present an efficient solution to solve the Fractional Knapsack problem.

**Answer:** Choose items in decreasing order of $v_i/w_i$ (value-to-weight ratio) and choose as much of each item as possible without exceeding total capacity W. Runtime is $O(n \log n)$ for sorting.

## b

Prove that the solution provided in part (a) is correct.

**Answer:** Assume a better solution O exists. Order items in O the same way (by $v_i/w_i$). Let item $i$ be the first where the fraction $p_i$ in our solution differs from $q_i$ in O. Since our solution uses as much of item $i$ as possible, $p_i > q_i$. We can improve O by increasing the fraction of item $i$ to $p_i$ and removing an equivalent weight from items $i+1$ and higher (which have lower $v_j/w_j$ ratios). This increases the total value of O, contradicting it being better. Therefore our greedy solution is optimal.
