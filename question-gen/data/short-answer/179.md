# Background

Consider an undirected, connected, weighted graph G (with both positive and negative edge costs).

# Parts

## a

True or False: Kruskal's algorithm may not correctly find an MST in the presence of negative cost edges. Explain your answer.

**Answer:** False. The proof of correctness for Kruskal's algorithm stays valid even if the edge costs are negative. Kruskal's processes edges in non-decreasing order and adds an edge if it does not create a cycle, regardless of sign.

## b

A Minimum Spanning Network (MSN) is a connected graph that contains a subset of edges of G, spans all nodes (but is not necessarily a tree), and has minimum total cost. True or False: Every MST in G is an MSN. Explain your answer.

**Answer:** False. G can have a cycle where all edges have negative costs. In that case, all those edges will belong to the MSN (since including them reduces total cost), but not all of them can be in the MST (since a tree cannot contain cycles).

## c

How would you modify Kruskal's algorithm to find an MSN? No proof is necessary.

**Answer:** First add all negative cost edges to the MSN, then proceed with positive cost edges as in Kruskal's to find an MST. Alternatively: when processing edges in non-decreasing order, discard an edge only if it creates a cycle AND has a positive cost; otherwise add it to the MSN.
