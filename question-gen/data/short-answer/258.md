# Background

You are given a set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}$ of points on the real line. Your task is to design a greedy algorithm that finds a smallest set of intervals, each of length 2, that contains all the given points.

# Parts

## a

Describe the steps of your greedy algorithm in plain English. What is its runtime complexity?

**Answer:** Sort $X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$. Let it be S. Initialize T = {}. While S is not empty: select the smallest x from S, add interval $[x, x+2]$ into T, remove all elements within $[x, x+2]$ from S. Return T. Runtime: $O(n \log n)$ for sorting, plus $O(n)$ for the greedy loop since each point is processed once.

## b

Argue that your algorithm correctly finds the smallest set of intervals.

**Answer:** Proof by exchange argument. Assume there is an optimal solution O with fewer intervals. Our intervals $(i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k)$ are never to the left of the corresponding optimal intervals $(j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_p)$.

Base case: $i_1$ starts at $x_1$ (the leftmost point). $j_1$ must also cover $x_1$, so $j_1$ starts at or before $x_1$. Thus $i_1$ is not to the left of $j_1$.

Inductive step: Assume $i_r$ is not to the left of $j_r$. The leftmost point not covered by $i_r$ requires $i_{r+1}$. Since $i_r$ is not to the left of $j_r$, $j_r$ cannot cover more to the right, so $j_{r+1}$ must also exist and cannot be further right than $i_{r+1}$.

If optimal has fewer intervals, then $j_{k-1}$ doesn't cover a point that our $i_k$ needs to cover, but since our intervals are never behind, the optimal would need that interval too. Contradiction. So our solution has the same size as optimal.
