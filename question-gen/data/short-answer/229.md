# Background

Given an undirected graph with vertices {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H} and weighted edges: A-B(4), A-C(3), A-D(5), B-D(5), B-E(9), C-D(5), C-H(5), D-G(5), D-H(4), E-F(3), F-G(2), G-H(6).

# Parts

## a

Use Prim's algorithm to obtain an MST of this graph. Use A as your starting point. Show the final MST and indicate the order in which you selected the edges.

**Answer:** Starting from A: 1) Add (A,C) weight 3. 2) Add (A,B) weight 4. 3) Add (D,H) weight 4 (via C or A to D=5, but D,H=4 is lighter when D is added). The order of edges selected by Prim's: (A,C), (A,B), (B,D) or (C,D), (D,H), (D,G), (G,F), (F,E). MST edges: (A,C), (A,B), (B,D), (D,H), (D,G), (G,F), (F,E).

## b

Use Kruskal's algorithm to obtain an MST. Show the final MST and indicate the order in which you selected the edges.

**Answer:** Sort edges by weight and add if no cycle: (G,F)=2, (E,F)=3, (A,C)=3, (A,B)=4, (D,H)=4, (B,D)=5 or (C,D)=5, (D,G)=5. MST edges in order: (G,F), (E,F), (A,C), (A,B), (D,H), (B,D), (D,G).

## c

Is the MST in this graph unique? If yes, explain why. If no, show edges that can be part of an MST but don't have to be part of every MST.

**Answer:** No, the MST is not unique. Edges (B,D) and (C,D) both have weight 5, and either can be used in the MST. Similarly, (C,H) has weight 5 and could substitute in some configurations. The non-unique edges are (B,D), (C,D), and (C,H).
