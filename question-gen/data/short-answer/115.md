# Background

There are six hobbits: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Bilbo, and Gollum. They want to pair and go adventuring. Each has preferences over who they want to be paired with:

Frodo: Sam > Bilbo > Merry > Pippin > Gollum
Merry: Pippin > Bilbo > Sam > Frodo > Gollum
Sam: Merry > Bilbo > Pippin > Frodo > Gollum
Gollum: Frodo > Merry > Pippin > Sam > Bilbo
Bilbo: Frodo > Merry > Sam > Pippin > Gollum
Pippin: Bilbo > Frodo > Sam > Merry > Gollum

A given matching (of hobbits into pairs) is not stable if there are two potential partners who are not currently paired but prefer each other over their respective current partners.

Prove or disprove: No matching is stable for the preferences given above.

**Answer:** True -- no stable matching exists. Notice that Gollum is the least preferred by everyone else. Someone must be matched with Gollum; call that hobbit A. Among the remaining hobbits, there must be a hobbit B who prefers A the most (since every hobbit other than Gollum appears as someone's first preference). Suppose B is paired with C (someone other than A, since A is paired with Gollum). Then A prefers B over their current partner Gollum, and B prefers A over C. This creates an instability. Since this argument applies regardless of who is matched with Gollum, every possible matching is unstable.
