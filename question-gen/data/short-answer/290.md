# Background

Problem 6.5-9 asks for an $O(n \\lg k)$ algorithm to merge $k$ sorted lists with $n$ total elements.

# Parts

## a

Describe the algorithm using a min-heap and explain why its running time is $O(n \lg k)$.

**Answer:** Initialize a min-heap of size $k$ with the first element from each list (storing value, list index, and position). Repeatedly extract the minimum from the heap and append it to the result. If the extracted element's list has more elements, insert the next one into the heap. Each of the $n$ total elements undergoes one EXTRACT-MIN and one INSERT on a heap of size at most $k$, each costing $O(\lg k)$. Total: $O(n \lg k)$.

## b

What is the space complexity of this algorithm?

**Answer:** $O(k)$ for the min-heap, which stores at most one element from each of the $k$ lists at any time, plus $O(n)$ for the output array.
