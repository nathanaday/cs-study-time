# Background

Suppose you want to drive from Los Angeles to New York. Your gas tank, when full, holds enough gas to drive $p$ miles. There are $n$ gas stations along the route at distances $d_1 \leq d_2 \leq \cdots \leq d_n$ from USC. The distance between any neighboring gas stations, and the distance between USC and the first gas station, as well as the distance between the last gas station and New York, are all at most $p$ miles. You start from USC with a full tank.

# Parts

## a

Design an efficient greedy algorithm for determining the minimum number of gas station stops to drive from Los Angeles to New York.

**Answer:** The greedy strategy is to go as far as possible before stopping for gas. At each gas station $i$, if you have enough gas to reach the next station $(i+1)$, skip station $i$. Otherwise, stop at station $i$ and fill up the tank.

## b

Prove that your greedy algorithm is correct (i.e., it produces an optimal solution).

**Answer:** Let $g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_m$ be the greedy stops and $h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_k$ be any optimal solution's stops. We prove by induction that $h_i \leq g_i$ for all $i$ (the greedy stops are always at least as far along as any optimal solution's stops). Base case: since it is not possible to pass $g_1$ without stopping, $h_1 \leq g_1$. Inductive step: assume $h_c \leq g_c$. Since we cannot reach $g_{c+1}$ from $g_c$ without stopping, and $h_c \leq g_c$, we also cannot reach $g_{c+1}$ from $h_c$, so $h_{c+1} \leq g_{c+1}$. Since the greedy stops are never earlier, any optimal solution needs at least $m$ stops, so the greedy is optimal.

## c

Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.

**Answer:** The running time is $O(n)$ since we make at most one $O(1)$ computation at each gas station (update remaining fuel and compare with distance to next station).
