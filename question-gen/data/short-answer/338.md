# Background

A complete binary tree $T$ with $n = 2^d - 1$ nodes has each node labeled with a distinct real number. A node $v$ is a local minimum if its label is smaller than all its neighbors (parent and children).

# Parts

## a

Give an algorithm to find a local minimum using $O(\log n)$ probes.

**Answer:** Start at the root. Probe it and its children. If the root is smaller than both children, return it. Otherwise, move to the child with the smaller label. At each step, probe the current node's children: if it is a local minimum, return it; otherwise descend to the smallest-labeled child. This takes $O(\log n)$ steps since the tree has depth $O(\log n)$.

## b

Why must the descent always find a local minimum?

**Answer:** At each step, we move to a neighbor with a strictly smaller value ($x_c < x_v$). Since all values are distinct and the tree is finite, this descent must terminate. When it terminates (at a leaf or when the current node is smaller than all neighbors), we have found a local minimum. The subtree rooted at the chosen child must contain a local minimum because the child's value is already smaller than its parent.
