# Background

You are given a DAG representing career paths. Each node is a position. An edge from $v$ to $u$ means $v$ is a prerequisite for $u$, with cost (effort) on each edge. Top positions are those with no outgoing prerequisite edges (not prerequisites for anything). Ivan wants to start a career and reach a top position with minimum effort.

# Parts

## a

Using the given graph, provide an algorithm with the same runtime complexity as Dijkstra's to find the minimum-effort career path to a top position.

**Answer:** Add a new virtual source node $S$ and connect it to all entry-level positions (nodes with no incoming edges) with zero-cost edges. Run Dijkstra's algorithm starting from $S$ to find shortest paths to all nodes. Among all top positions (nodes with no outgoing edges), find the one $t$ with the lowest distance from $S$. The minimum-effort career path is the shortest path from $S$ to $t$ (excluding the virtual node $S$). The runtime matches Dijkstra's: $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with a priority queue.
