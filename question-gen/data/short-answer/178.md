# Background

We have a list of N pets consisting of some dogs and others cats. We know the list has all dogs listed first, followed by all cats. You can make queries of the form "Is the $n$-th pet on the list a dog or a cat?" for any $n \\leq N$. You want to determine how many dogs and how many cats are on the list.

## a

Devise an algorithm to do this by asking $o(n)$ (little o) number of queries (along with time complexity analysis to show it has the desired efficiency). Note that the simple algorithm making a pass over all pets would make $\Theta(n)$ queries, thus not meeting the requirements.

**Answer:** Use divide and conquer (binary search). To get count(L) for the number of cats on any input list L, consider equal halves T and B. Make a query for the pet ranked |T|. If dog, output count(B). If cat, output count(T) + |B|. Base case for |L| = 1: just query that pet. The recurrence is $T(n) = T(n/2) + 1$, and thus $T(n) = O(\log n)$ by Master Theorem. This is asymptotically strictly slower than linear as required.
