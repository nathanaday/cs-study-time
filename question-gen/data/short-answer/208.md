## a

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected undirected graph with edge-weight function $w$, and assume all edge weights are distinct. Consider a cycle $\langle v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k, v_{k+1} \rangle$ in G, where $v_{k+1} = v_1$, and let $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ be the edge in the cycle with the largest edge weight. Prove that $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ does not belong to the minimum spanning tree T of G.

**Answer:** Proof by contradiction. Assume $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ does belong to the MST T. Removing $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ from T divides T into two connected components A and B, where some nodes of the cycle are in A and some are in B. Since the cycle must cross this cut, there is some other edge $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ on the cycle that connects A and B. Adding this edge creates another spanning tree T'. Since the weight of $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ is less than $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ (because $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ is the heaviest in the cycle), the weight of T' is less than T. This contradicts T being an MST.
