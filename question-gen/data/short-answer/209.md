# Background

Each of the following problems suggests a greedy algorithm for a specified task. Prove that the greedy algorithm is optimal, or give a counterexample to show that it is not.

# Parts

## a

Problem: You are given a set of $n$ jobs. Job $i$ starts at time $s_i$, ends at time $e_i$, and results in profit $q_i$. Only one job may run at a time. Goal: choose a subset to maximize total profit. Algorithm: Sort jobs so that $q_1 \geq q_2 \geq \ldots \geq q_n$. Then try to add each job; if it conflicts, discard it. Is this algorithm optimal?

**Answer:** This algorithm is NOT optimal. Counterexample: Three jobs with starts {1, 1, 3}, ends {4, 2, 4}, and profits {3, 2, 2}. The greedy picks job 1 (profit 3) and cannot fit jobs 2 or 3. But picking jobs 2 and 3 gives profit 4, which is better.

## b

Problem: You are given $n$ unit-time jobs, each with integer deadline $d_i \geq 0$ and penalty $p_i \geq 0$. Jobs may start at any integer time. If job $i$ completes by time $d_i$, no penalty; otherwise penalty $p_i$. Goal: schedule all jobs to minimize total penalty. Algorithm: Sort by $p_1 \geq p_2 \geq \ldots \geq p_n$. For each job $i$, schedule it in the latest available time slot at or before $d_i$; otherwise place it in the latest available slot $\leq n$. Is this algorithm optimal?

**Answer:** Yes, this algorithm is optimal. Proof by exchange argument: Start with an arbitrary optimal solution O_0. We show we can transform it into the greedy solution without increasing total penalty. Consider job_1 (highest penalty). If it is in a different position in O_0 than in the greedy solution, we can swap job_1 with whatever job occupies its greedy position. This swap does not increase total penalty because job_1 has the highest penalty and moving it to a better position can only help. By induction on job_k, we can swap each subsequent job into its greedy position without increasing penalty, eventually transforming O_0 into the greedy solution.
