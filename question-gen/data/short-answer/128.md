# Background

For each of the following pairs of functions, indicate whether $f = O(g)$, $f = \Theta(g)$, or $f = \Omega(g)$.

# Parts

## a

$f(n) = n^{2/3}$, $g(n) = (\log(n))^3$

**Answer:** $f = \Omega(g)$. Any polynomial grows faster than any polylogarithmic function, so $n^{2/3}$ dominates $(\log n)^3$.

## b

$f(n) = n\log(n)$, $g(n) = n^2 \log(n^2)$

**Answer:** $f = O(g)$. Since $n^2 \log(n^2) = 2n^2 \log n$, we have $g$ grows faster than $f$ because of the extra factor of $n$.

## c

$f(n) = \log(n)$, $g(n) = \log(\log(5^n))$

**Answer:** $f = \Theta(g)$. Note $\log(\log(5^n)) = \log(n \log 5) = \log n + \log(\log 5)$, so $f$ and $g$ differ by only a constant, giving $f = \Theta(g)$.

## d

$f(n) = 2^n$, $g(n) = 2^{3n}$

**Answer:** $f = O(g)$. $2^{3n} = (2^n)^3 = 8^n$, which grows exponentially faster than $2^n$.

## e

$f(n) = n^4 / \log(n)$, $g(n) = n(\log(n))^4$

**Answer:** $f = \Omega(g)$. $f/g = n^3 / (\log n)^5$, which goes to infinity as $n$ grows, so $f$ dominates $g$.
