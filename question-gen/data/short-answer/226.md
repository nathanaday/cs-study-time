## a

In the MERGE-SORT algorithm we merge two sorted lists into one sorted list in $O(n)$ time. Describe an $O(n \log k)$-time algorithm to merge $k$ sorted lists into one sorted list, where $n$ is the total number of elements in all the input lists. Be sure to explain why your algorithm runs in $O(n \log k)$-time.

**Answer:** Build a min-priority queue (min-heap) containing the smallest element from each of the $k$ sorted lists, taking $O(k)$ time. Repeat: extract the minimum from the priority queue in $O(\log k)$ time (this is the next element in sorted order). From the list that element came from, insert the next smallest element into the priority queue in $O(\log k)$ time. Continue until the queue is empty. Since we process all $n$ elements and each extract-min and insert costs $O(\log k)$, the total running time is $O(k + n \log k) = O(n \log k)$.
