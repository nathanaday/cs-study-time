# Background

You have $n$ computers and $m$ communication triples $(C_i, C_j, t_k)$ sorted by time. A virus is inserted into computer $C_a$ at time $x$. Determine whether it could have infected computer $C_b$ by time $y$.

# Parts

## a

Give an $O(m+n)$ algorithm for this problem.

**Answer:** Mark $C_a$ as infected at time $x$. Process the triples in sorted time order. For each triple $(C_i, C_j, t_k)$ with $x \le t_k \le y$: if $C_i$ is infected (with infection time $\le t_k$), mark $C_j$ as infected at time $t_k$, and vice versa. After processing all triples, check whether $C_b$ is infected.

## b

Why does processing triples in chronological order ensure correctness?

**Answer:** Since triples are processed in chronological order, when we reach triple $(C_i, C_j, t_k)$, all infections that could have occurred before time $t_k$ have already been recorded. The infection spreads correctly along time-respecting paths because we never process a later communication before an earlier one.
