## a

Arrange the following functions in increasing order of growth rate with $g(n)$ following $f(n)$ iff $f(n) = O(g(n))$: $n^2 \log n$, $2^n$, $2^{2n}$, $n^{\log n}$, $n^2$

**Answer:** $n^2$, $n^2 \log n$, $n^{\log n}$, $2^n$, $2^{2n}$. Polynomials grow slower than quasi-polynomials ($n^{\log n}$), which grow slower than exponentials. Among polynomials, $n^2 < n^2 \log n$. Among exponentials, $2^n < 2^{2n} = 4^n$.
