# Background

You are given an array $A[1 \ldots n]$ of $n$ integers and want to compute an $n \times n$ array $B$ where $B[i,j] = A[i] + A[i+1] + \cdots + A[j]$ for $i < j$.

# Parts

## a

The naive algorithm (three nested loops) runs in what time complexity, and why?

**Answer:** $\Theta(n^3)$. For each pair $(i,j)$, the algorithm sums $j-i+1$ entries. The total work is $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} (j-i+1) = \Theta(n^3)$.

## b

Describe an $O(n^2)$ algorithm using prefix sums.

**Answer:** Compute prefix sums $P[0] = 0$, $P[k] = A[1] + \cdots + A[k]$ in $O(n)$ time. Then $B[i,j] = P[j] - P[i-1]$ in $O(1)$ per entry. Since there are $\binom{n}{2}$ entries, total time is $O(n^2)$.
