# Background

For each of the following recurrences, give an expression for the runtime T(n) if the recurrence can be solved with the Master Theorem. Otherwise, indicate that the Master Theorem does not apply.

# Parts

## 1

$T(n) = 16T(n/4) + 5n^3$

**Answer:** Case 3: $a=16, b=4$, $n^{\log_4 16} = n^2$. Since $f(n) = 5n^3 = \Omega(n^{2+\epsilon})$ with $\epsilon=1$, and regularity holds ($16 \cdot 5(n/4)^3 = 5n^3/4 \leq cn^3$ for $c=1/4$), $T(n) = \Theta(n^3)$.

## 2

$T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^2 \log n$

**Answer:** Case 2: $a=4, b=2$, $n^{\log_2 4} = n^2$. Since $f(n) = n^2 \log n = \Theta(n^2 \log^k n)$ with $k=1$, $T(n) = \Theta(n^2 \log^2 n)$.

## 3

$T(n) = 4T(n/8) - n^2$

**Answer:** Master Theorem does not apply because $f(n) = -n^2$ is negative. The Master Theorem requires $f(n)$ to be asymptotically positive.

## 4

$T(n) = 2^n T(n/2) + n$

**Answer:** Master Theorem does not apply because $a = 2^n$ is not a constant. The Master Theorem requires $a \geq 1$ to be a constant.

## 5

$T(n) = 0.2 T(n/2) + n \log n$

**Answer:** Master Theorem does not apply because $a = 0.2 < 1$. The Master Theorem requires $a \geq 1$.

## 6

$T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n/\log n$

**Answer:** Case 1: $a=4, b=2$, $n^{\log_2 4} = n^2$. Since $f(n) = n/\log n = O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ for $\epsilon = 1/2$, $T(n) = \Theta(n^2)$.
