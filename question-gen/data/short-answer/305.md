# Background

You have a ladder with $n$ rungs and want to find the highest safe rung from which a jar can be dropped without breaking. You have a budget of $k$ jars.

# Parts

## a

With $k = 2$ jars, describe a strategy using $O(\sqrt{n})$ drops.

**Answer:** Drop the first jar from rungs $\sqrt{n}, 2\sqrt{n}, 3\sqrt{n}, \ldots$ until it breaks (at most $\sqrt{n}$ drops). If it breaks at rung $i\sqrt{n}$, use the second jar to linearly scan rungs $(i-1)\sqrt{n}+1$ through $i\sqrt{n}$ (at most $\sqrt{n}$ drops). Total: $O(\sqrt{n})$.

## b

Generalize to $k$ jars. What is the drop complexity, and why does each $f_k$ grow slower than $f_{k-1}$?

**Answer:** $O(k \cdot n^{1/k})$ drops. Divide the $n$ rungs into $n^{1/k}$ blocks of size $n^{(k-1)/k}$. Use one jar to identify the correct block ($n^{1/k}$ drops), then recurse with $k-1$ jars on a block of size $n^{(k-1)/k}$. Each $f_k(n) = O(k \cdot n^{1/k})$ grows slower than $f_{k-1}(n) = O((k-1) \cdot n^{1/(k-1)})$ since $n^{1/k - 1/(k-1)} \to 0$.
