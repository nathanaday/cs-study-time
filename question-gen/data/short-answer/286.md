# Background

HEAP-DELETE$(A, i)$ removes the element at index $i$ from a max-heap in $O(\lg n)$ time.

# Parts

## a

Describe the algorithm for HEAP-DELETE$(A, i)$.

**Answer:** Replace $A[i]$ with $A[A.\text{heap-size}]$ and decrement heap-size. If the replacement value is larger than $A[\text{PARENT}(i)]$, bubble it up (like HEAP-INCREASE-KEY). Otherwise, call MAX-HEAPIFY$(A, i)$ to sink it down. Either path traverses at most $O(\lg n)$ levels.

## b

Describe a simpler (but equivalent) two-step approach to HEAP-DELETE using existing priority queue operations.

**Answer:** First call HEAP-INCREASE-KEY$(A, i, +\infty)$ to bubble the element to the root, then call HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX$(A)$ to remove it. Both operations are $O(\lg n)$, so the total is $O(\lg n)$.
