# Background

You plan to have an awesome long weekend. There are $n$ activities, where each activity has a degree of enjoyment $e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n$ and it takes time $t_k$ to complete the $k$-th activity. If you finish an activity, you receive its full degree of enjoyment. If you give up on an activity without finishing, you receive enjoyment proportional to the time you spent on it. You have $T$ total time available.

# Parts

## a

Design a greedy algorithm to decide on the optimal set of activities to complete in order to maximize your total enjoyment.

**Answer:** Calculate the enjoyment density $e_i / t_i$ for each activity $i$. Sort activities in descending order of $e_i / t_i$. Do activities in this order: complete each activity fully until you run out of time. If you cannot finish the next activity, spend all remaining time on it (earning proportional enjoyment).

## b

Prove the correctness of your algorithm.

**Answer:** Greedy-choice property: Suppose an optimal solution does not start with the highest-density activity. Swapping the first activity with the highest-density one yields at least as much enjoyment, since the higher density means more enjoyment per unit time. So an optimal solution always starts with the best density. Optimal substructure: After choosing the best activity, the remaining subproblem (maximize enjoyment with remaining time) has the same form. The greedy strategy applies recursively.

## c

Justify the time complexity of your algorithm.

**Answer:** The algorithm is dominated by the sorting step, which takes $O(n \log n)$. Computing densities takes $O(n)$ and the greedy selection pass takes $O(n)$. Total: $O(n \log n)$.
