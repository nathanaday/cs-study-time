# Background

Consider the heap $A = \langle 15, 13, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1 \rangle$ with heap-size 12.

# Parts

## a

What value does HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX return, and what is the resulting heap?

**Answer:** HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX returns 15. The last element (1) is moved to the root and the heap-size decreases to 11. After MAX-HEAPIFY: 1 swaps with 13, then with 12, then with 6, yielding $[13, 12, 9, 5, 6, 8, 7, 4, 0, 1, 2]$.

## b

Starting from the original heap, show the result of MAX-HEAP-INSERT$(A, 10)$.

**Answer:** Heap-size becomes 13, $A[13] = -\infty$, then HEAP-INCREASE-KEY sets $A[13] = 10$. Compare with parent $A[6] = 8$: swap (10 > 8). Compare with parent $A[3] = 9$: swap (10 > 9). Compare with parent $A[1] = 15$: stop (10 < 15). Final heap: $[15, 13, 10, 5, 12, 9, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1, 8]$.
