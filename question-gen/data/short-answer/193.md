# Background

We are given a sequence of N positive numbers. A subsequence is non-consecutive if it does not contain a pair of numbers that appear consecutively in the given sequence. Our goal is to find the highest sum possible for a non-consecutive subsequence. Example: For the sequence [2, 5, 1, 3, 8, 10, 8], the non-consecutive subsequence with the highest sum is [5, 8, 8] as highlighted.

## a

Design an efficient divide-and-conquer based algorithm. Analyze its time complexity (using Master Theorem or otherwise).

**Answer:** Suppose function f computes the required answer. It is implemented using divide-and-conquer as follows: Given sequence S of size n, make cases on whether the middle element S[n/2] is included in the answer.

Case 1) Included: Elements to the left and right of S[n/2] must be omitted. Let L = S[1, ..., n/2-2], R = S[n/2+2, ..., n]. Answer candidate = f(L) + f(R) + S[n/2].

Case 2) Not included: Elements on both sides may be included independently. Let L = S[1, ..., n/2-1], R = S[n/2+1, ..., n]. Answer candidate = f(L) + f(R).

Compare both cases and return the higher value. Base case: if n <= 2, return the highest element (or 0 if empty).

The recurrence is T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(1). Using Master's Theorem, this yields T(n) = O(n^2).
