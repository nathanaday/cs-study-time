# Background

The array $A$ below holds a binary max-heap:
$A = \{26, 14, 10, 8, 11, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1\}$

# Parts

## a

What will be the order of elements in array $A$ after a new entry with value 19 is inserted into this heap? Show all your work (each swap step).

**Answer:** Step 1 -- Insert 19 at the end: $\{26, 14, 10, 8, 11, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1, 19\}$ (index 11). Step 2 -- Compare 19 with parent at index $\lfloor 11/2 \rfloor = 5$, which is 11. Since $19 > 11$, swap: $\{26, 14, 10, 8, 19, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1, 11\}$. Step 3 -- Compare 19 with parent at index $\lfloor 5/2 \rfloor = 2$, which is 14. Since $19 > 14$, swap: $\{26, 19, 10, 8, 14, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1, 11\}$. Step 4 -- Compare 19 with parent at index $\lfloor 2/2 \rfloor = 1$, which is 26. Since $19 < 26$, no swap. Final array: $\{26, 19, 10, 8, 14, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1, 11\}$.
