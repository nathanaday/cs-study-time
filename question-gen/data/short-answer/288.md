# Background

Problem 6-2 from Cormen analyzes $d$-ary heaps, a generalization of binary heaps where each node has up to $d$ children.

# Parts

## a

In a $d$-ary heap stored in an array starting at index 1, give formulas for PARENT$(i)$ and the $j$-th child CHILD$(i, j)$ where $j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, d\}$.

**Answer:** PARENT$(i) = \lceil (i-1)/d \rceil$ (equivalently $\lfloor (i + d - 2)/d \rfloor$). CHILD$(i, j) = d(i-1) + j + 1$. The first child is $d(i-1) + 2$ and the last child is $di + 1$.

## b

Explain why increasing $d$ benefits INSERT/INCREASE-KEY but hurts EXTRACT-MAX.

**Answer:** Increasing $d$ reduces the tree height to $\Theta(\log_d n)$, which directly benefits INSERT and INCREASE-KEY since they bubble up through $O(\log_d n)$ levels with $O(1)$ work per level. However, EXTRACT-MAX must compare with all $d$ children at each level when sinking down, giving $O(d \log_d n)$ -- the factor of $d$ per level outweighs the reduced height.
