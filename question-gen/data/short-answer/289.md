# Background

Problem 6-3 from Cormen introduces the Young tableau: an $m \\times n$ matrix where rows are sorted left-to-right and columns are sorted top-to-bottom, with $\\infty$ used for empty entries.

# Parts

## a

How can you determine in $O(1)$ time whether a Young tableau is empty or full?

**Answer:** The tableau is empty if and only if $Y[1,1] = \infty$ (since all entries must be $\ge Y[1,1]$ by the sorting property). It is full if and only if $Y[m,n] < \infty$ (since all entries must be $\le Y[m,n]$).

## b

Describe an $O(m+n)$ algorithm to search for a key in an $m \times n$ Young tableau.

**Answer:** Start at the top-right corner $Y[1, n]$. If $Y[i,j] = \text{key}$, return found. If $\text{key} > Y[i,j]$, move down ($i = i+1$) since the key must be in a lower row. If $\text{key} < Y[i,j]$, move left ($j = j-1$) since the key must be in an earlier column. Each step eliminates a row or column, so at most $m + n - 1$ steps are taken.

## c

What is the running time of sorting $n^2$ numbers using an $n \times n$ Young tableau?

**Answer:** $O(n^3)$. Insert all $n^2$ numbers into the tableau ($n^2$ insertions, each $O(n+n) = O(n)$), then extract the minimum $n^2$ times ($n^2$ extractions, each $O(n)$). Total: $n^2 \cdot O(n) + n^2 \cdot O(n) = O(n^3)$.
