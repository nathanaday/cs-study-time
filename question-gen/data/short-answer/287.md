# Background

The HEAP-INCREASE-KEY procedure can be optimized to use fewer assignments per iteration.

# Parts

## a

The standard HEAP-INCREASE-KEY uses 3 assignments per swap (via exchange). Describe how to reduce this to 1 assignment per iteration, similar to the optimization used in insertion sort.

**Answer:** Save the key in a temporary variable. Instead of swapping, shift the parent value down into the child position (one assignment per iteration): $A[i] = A[\text{PARENT}(i)]$, then $i = \text{PARENT}(i)$. After the loop ends, place the saved key at its final position: $A[i] = \text{temp}$. This reduces from $3k$ assignments to $k+1$ for $k$ iterations.
