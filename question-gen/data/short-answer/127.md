# Background

Find the tight bound (in terms of input parameter $n$) on the worst-case runtime of the procedure below:

int c = 0;
for(int k = 0; k <= log(n); k++)
    for(int j = 1; j <= 2^k; j++)
        c = c + 1
return c

## a

What is the tight asymptotic bound on the worst-case runtime?

**Answer:** $\Theta(n)$. A single iteration of the inner loop takes $O(1)$ time. The inner loop runs for $2^k$ iterations for each $k$. As $k$ varies from 0 to $\log n$, the total iterations are $\sum_{k=0}^{\log n} 2^k = 2^{\log(n)+1} - 1 = 2n - 1$. Therefore the time complexity is $\Theta(n)$.
