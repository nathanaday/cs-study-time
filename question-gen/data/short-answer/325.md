# Background

Given two sequences $S'$ (length $m$) and $S$ (length $n$), determine whether $S'$ is a subsequence of $S$.

# Parts

## a

Describe an $O(m+n)$ greedy algorithm and explain why greedy matching (earliest possible) is optimal.

**Answer:** Use two pointers: $i$ into $S'$ and $j$ into $S$. While both are in bounds: if $S'[i] = S[j]$, advance $i$ (match found); always advance $j$. If $i > m$ at the end, $S'$ is a subsequence. Greedy matching to the earliest occurrence is optimal because matching earlier never hurts -- it leaves more of $S$ available for matching later elements of $S'$.
