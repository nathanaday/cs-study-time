# Background

The hospital-resident matching problem has $m$ hospitals (each with capacity $c_h$) and $n$ students ($n > \sum_h c_h$). A stable assignment must avoid two types of instability: (1) a hospital prefers an unassigned student over one of its assigned students, and (2) a hospital and student mutually prefer each other over their current assignments.

# Parts

## a

Describe how to adapt the Gale-Shapley algorithm to find a stable assignment in this setting.

**Answer:** Use hospital-proposing Gale-Shapley where each hospital can hold up to $c_h$ students. While a hospital $h$ has an open position and hasn't proposed to every student, it proposes to its highest-ranked unproposed student. If the student is unassigned, she accepts. If assigned to $h'$ and prefers $h$, she switches (freeing a spot at $h'$). Otherwise she rejects.

## b

Why does this algorithm avoid Type 1 instabilities (hospital $h$ has student $s$ assigned, but prefers unassigned student $s'$)?

**Answer:** If $h$ prefers $s'$ to $s$, then $h$ proposed to $s'$ before $s$. If $s'$ is unassigned at the end, $h$ must have proposed to $s'$ and $s'$ accepted some hospital then later ended up unassigned -- but students only switch to hospitals they prefer more, never become unassigned after accepting. So $s'$ unassigned means no hospital proposed to $s'$, contradicting that $h$ did. Hence no Type 1 instability exists.
