# Background

Your friend is organizing a mini-triathlon: each contestant must swim 20 laps, bike 10 miles, then run 3 miles. Contestants use the pool one at a time (sequentially), but biking and running happen independently after leaving the pool. Each contestant has a projected swimming time, biking time, and running time. The completion time of the schedule is the earliest time at which all contestants finish all three legs.

What is the best order for sending contestants to minimize the overall completion time? Give an efficient algorithm and prove it achieves the optimal schedule.

**Answer:** Sort the athletes by decreasing (biking + running) time. Send them into the pool in this order. Proof by exchange argument: Define an inversion as athlete $i$ with higher $(b_i + r_i)$ being scheduled after athlete $j$ with lower $(b_j + r_j)$. We show inversions can be removed without increasing completion time. Consider two adjacent athletes with an inversion. Moving athlete $i$ (higher bike+run) earlier does not increase $i$'s completion time. Moving athlete $j$ later pushes out $j$'s pool exit, but since $j$ is faster at biking+running, $j$'s new completion time does not exceed $i$'s old completion time. So removing any inversion does not worsen the schedule. Iteratively removing all inversions yields our sorted order, proving it is optimal. Time complexity: $O(n \log n)$ for sorting.
