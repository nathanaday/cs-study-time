# Question

Given a graph with positive, distinct edge costs and MST $T$, if we replace each edge cost $c_e$ by $c_e^2$, then $T$ must still be the MST under the new costs.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Since all costs are positive and distinct, squaring preserves the ordering: $c_e < c_f$ if and only if $c_e^2 < c_f^2$. The MST depends only on the relative ordering of edge costs (Kruskal's and Prim's only compare edges). Since the ordering is unchanged, the same tree $T$ is the MST under squared costs.
