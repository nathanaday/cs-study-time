# Question

In an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, an edge $e = \{u, v\}$ represents an asymmetric relationship, meaning $u$ being connected to $v$ does not imply $v$ is connected to $u$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

An edge in an undirected graph represents a **symmetric** relationship. If $u$ is connected to $v$, then $v$ is connected to $u$. Asymmetric relationships are modeled by **directed graphs**, where edge $(u,v) \neq (v,u)$.
