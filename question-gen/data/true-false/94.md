# Question

In the Gale-Shapley algorithm with men proposing, each man is paired with his worst valid partner.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

By statement (1.7), each man is paired with his **best** valid partner. A valid partner of man $m$ is any woman $w$ such that $(m, w)$ appears in some stable matching. The Gale-Shapley algorithm (with men proposing) is man-optimal: every man gets the best partner he could hope for in any stable matching.
