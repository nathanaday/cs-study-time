# Question

During a given recursive call $\text{DFS}(u)$, all nodes that are marked "Explored" between the invocation and completion of that call are ancestors of $u$ in the DFS tree $T$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

By theorem (3.6), all nodes marked "Explored" between the invocation and end of $\text{DFS}(u)$ are **descendants** of $u$ in $T$, not ancestors. This follows from the recursive structure: anything discovered during $\text{DFS}(u)$ is found through recursive calls that are children or further descendants of $u$.
