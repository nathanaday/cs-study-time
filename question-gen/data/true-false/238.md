# Question

A minimum spanning tree of a bipartite graph is not necessarily a bipartite graph.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

An MST of a bipartite graph is always bipartite. The MST is a subgraph of the original bipartite graph. Any subgraph of a bipartite graph is also bipartite, since removing edges cannot create odd cycles.
