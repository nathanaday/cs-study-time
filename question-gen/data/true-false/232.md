# Question

Inserting an element into a binary min-heap takes $O(1)$ time if the new element is greater than all the existing elements in the min heap.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If the new element is greater than all existing elements, it is placed at the next available position (end of the array) and no bubble-up is needed since it is already larger than its parent. The insertion takes $O(1)$ time.
