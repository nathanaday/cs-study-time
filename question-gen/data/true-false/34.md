# Question

In the iterative implementation of DFS, a node $v$ can appear on the stack multiple times -- once for each neighbor that pushes $v$ -- and this does not affect correctness.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Multiple copies of $v$ may exist on the stack because each explored neighbor of $v$ pushes $v$ independently. Correctness is preserved because when a duplicate copy of $v$ is popped, the algorithm checks if $v$ is already marked "Explored" and simply skips it if so.
