# Question

The worst-case running time of HEAPSORT is $\Omega(n \lg n)$, meaning it is asymptotically optimal among comparison-based sorting algorithms.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

HEAPSORT makes $n-1$ calls to MAX-HEAPIFY. For at least the first $n/2$ iterations, the heap has size at least $n/2$, so each MAX-HEAPIFY takes $\Omega(\lg(n/2)) = \Omega(\lg n)$ in the worst case. This gives a lower bound of $(n/2) \cdot \Omega(\lg n) = \Omega(n \lg n)$. Since any comparison-based sort requires $\Omega(n \lg n)$ comparisons, HEAPSORT is asymptotically optimal.
