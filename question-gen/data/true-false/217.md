# Question

Master's Theorem can be used to calculate the running time of any recursive function.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The Master Theorem only applies to recurrences of the form $T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)$ where $a \\geq 1$ and $b > 1$. It cannot handle recurrences with multiple different-sized subproblems, non-constant $a$, $a < 1$, or non-polynomial gaps between $f(n)$ and $n^{\\log_b a}$ that don't fit any of the three cases.
