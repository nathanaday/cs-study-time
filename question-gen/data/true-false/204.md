# Question

Height of a binary heap is $O(n)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

The height of a binary heap with $n$ elements is $\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor = O(\\log n)$. Since $O(\\log n) \\subseteq O(n)$, the statement $O(n)$ is technically true (though not a tight bound). The height is indeed bounded by $n$.
