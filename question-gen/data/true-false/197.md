# Question

If G is a directed acyclic graph, then G must have a node with no incoming edges.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

In any DAG, there must be at least one node with in-degree 0. If every node had an incoming edge, we could follow incoming edges indefinitely, and since the graph is finite, we would eventually revisit a node, creating a cycle -- contradicting the acyclic property.
