# Question

The Gale-Shapley algorithm always returns a perfect matching.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By statement (1.5), the algorithm cannot terminate with a free man. If it did, that man would have already proposed to every woman, contradicting (1.4). Since no man is free at termination and the set of engaged pairs forms a matching, it must be a perfect matching.
