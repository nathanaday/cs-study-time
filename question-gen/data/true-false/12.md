# Question

In an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with $m = |E|$ edges, the sum of the degrees of all nodes equals $2m$, i.e., $\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2m$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Each edge $e = \{v, w\}$ contributes exactly 1 to the degree of $v$ and 1 to the degree of $w$, so it contributes 2 to the total sum of degrees across all nodes.
