# Question

In the minimum cost arborescence algorithm, when we subtract $y_v$ (the minimum cost edge entering node $v$) from all edges entering $v$, this changes which arborescence is optimal.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Every arborescence must have exactly one edge entering each non-root node $v$. So every arborescence's total cost changes by exactly the same amount (the sum of all $y_v$ values). This preserves the relative ordering, so the optimal arborescence remains optimal under the modified costs.
