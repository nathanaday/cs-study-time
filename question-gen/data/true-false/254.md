# Question

Any function which is $\Omega(\log \log n)$ is also $\Omega(\log n)$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

$\\log \\log n$ grows slower than $\\log n$. A function can be $\\Omega(\\log \\log n)$ without being $\\Omega(\\log n)$. For example, $f(n) = \\log \\log n$ is $\\Omega(\\log \\log n)$ but not $\\Omega(\\log n)$ since $\\log \\log n / \\log n \\to 0$.
