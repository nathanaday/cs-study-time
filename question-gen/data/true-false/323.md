# Question

For any connected graph $G$ and any MST $T$ of $G$, there exists a valid execution of Kruskal's algorithm that produces $T$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Among edges of the same cost, order those in $T$ before those not in $T$. Edges of $T$ never create a cycle with previously added $T$-edges (since $T$ is acyclic). Non-$T$ edges of cost $c$ create cycles because all $T$-edges of cost $\le c$ are already added, and adding any non-$T$ edge to a spanning tree creates a cycle where all other edges have cost $\le c$ (otherwise we could improve the MST). So Kruskal's with this ordering produces exactly $T$.
