# Question

Consider a stable matching problem with $n$ men and $n$ women, for $n > 2$. If man M prefers woman W the least and W prefers M the least as well, then the pair (M,W) cannot be part of a stable matching.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Even if M and W rank each other last, the pair (M,W) can still be part of a stable matching. A matching is unstable only if there exists a blocking pair where both prefer each other over their current partners. If all other men and women are matched in a way that no blocking pair exists, (M,W) can be stable. For example, with n=2, if both pairs rank each other last, both possible matchings are stable.
