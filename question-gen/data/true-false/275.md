# Question

BUILD-MAX-HEAP and BUILD-MAX-HEAP$'$ (which builds a heap by repeated insertion) always produce the same heap for any input array.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

They generally produce different heaps. For example, with input $A = [1, 2, 3]$: BUILD-MAX-HEAP (bottom-up) produces $[3, 2, 1]$, while BUILD-MAX-HEAP$'$ (repeated insertion) may produce $[3, 1, 2]$. The two procedures process elements in different orders and use different operations (MAX-HEAPIFY vs. bubbling up), leading to different valid max-heaps.
