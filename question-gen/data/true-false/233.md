# Question

Using the Master's Theorem the asymptotic bounds for the recurrence $2T(n/4) + n$ is $\Theta(n)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

$a = 2, b = 4$, so $n^{\\log_b a} = n^{\\log_4 2} = n^{1/2} = \\sqrt{n}$. Since $f(n) = n = \\Omega(n^{1/2 + \\epsilon})$ for $\\epsilon = 1/2$, this is Case 3. Regularity: $2f(n/4) = 2(n/4) = n/2 \\leq cn$ for $c = 1/2 < 1$. So $T(n) = \\Theta(n)$.
