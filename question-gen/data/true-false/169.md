# Question

Suppose you have a directed graph $G$ with a source vertex $s$, a target vertex $t$, and nonnegative edge weights. Furthermore, each edge has a distinct length that is a power of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., and no two edges share the same power of 2). Then the shortest $s$-$t$ path (in terms of total length) is guaranteed to be unique.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Since each edge weight is a distinct power of 2, the sum of any subset of edges is unique (by properties of binary representation). Therefore, no two different paths can have the same total length, guaranteeing the shortest path is unique.
