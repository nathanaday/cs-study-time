# Question

There exists an optimal schedule with no idle time, meaning the resource is never sitting unused while jobs remain in the queue.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is statement (4.7). Inserting idle time can only delay subsequent jobs and potentially increase their lateness. Any idle time can be removed by shifting later jobs forward without increasing maximum lateness, so an optimal schedule without idle time always exists.
