# Question

If a graph $G$ has a valid 2-coloring, then any edge in $G$ must connect a node in an even-numbered BFS layer to a node in an odd-numbered BFS layer.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

While a valid 2-coloring exists, not all edges necessarily connect even and odd layers. This statement would only be true if we're specifically using BFS from a particular starting node. However, if the graph is bipartite and BFS produces a valid coloring with no intra-layer edges, _then_ every edge connects adjacent (even-to-odd) layers for that particular BFS tree.
