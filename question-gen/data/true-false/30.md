# Question

In DFS, non-tree edges connect nodes in the same or adjacent layers, similar to how non-tree edges behave in BFS.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

This describes BFS, not DFS. In a BFS tree, non-tree edges connect nodes whose layers differ by at most 1 (horizontal connections). In a DFS tree, non-tree edges connect ancestors to descendants (vertical connections). This structural difference has deep algorithmic consequences.
