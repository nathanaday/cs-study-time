# Question

In the Gale-Shapley algorithm (with men proposing), the sequence of partners to which a woman is engaged gets worse and worse over time in terms of her preference list.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The opposite is true. By statement (1.1), once a woman receives her first proposal and becomes engaged, each subsequent engagement is to a man she prefers at least as much. A woman only switches partners when she receives a proposal from someone she likes better than her current partner.
