# Question

If all the edge weights of a given graph are the same, then every spanning tree of that graph is minimum.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If all edge weights are equal (say weight $w$), then every spanning tree of an $n$-vertex connected graph has exactly $n-1$ edges, each with weight $w$. The total weight is always $(n-1)w$ regardless of which spanning tree is chosen. Therefore every spanning tree is minimum.
