# Question

The BFS-based bipartite testing algorithm has time complexity $O(n^2)$ for a graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The algorithm runs in $O(m + n)$ time. It performs standard BFS which takes $O(m + n)$ time, then scans all edges once to verify the coloring, which takes $O(m)$ time. The total is $O(m + n)$, which is linear in the size of the graph, not quadratic.
