# Question

In a directed graph, BFS from a node $s$ finds all nodes that can reach $s$, not all nodes that $s$ can reach.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

BFS from $s$ in a directed graph finds all nodes that $s$ can reach by following edges in their forward direction. To find all nodes that can reach $s$, we must construct the reverse graph $G^{rev}$ (by flipping all edges) and run BFS from $s$ in $G^{rev}$.
