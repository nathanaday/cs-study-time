# Question

For any two nodes $s$ and $t$ in a directed graph, their strong components are either identical or disjoint.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is statement (3.17). If $s$ and $t$ are mutually reachable, their strong components are identical (by transitivity, they're mutually reachable with the same set of nodes). If $s$ and $t$ are not mutually reachable, their strong components must be disjoint -- otherwise a shared node would make them mutually reachable by transitivity, a contradiction.
