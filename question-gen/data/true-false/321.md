# Question

Every minimum spanning tree is a minimum-bottleneck spanning tree.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Let $T$ be the MST with bottleneck edge $e^*$. Removing $e^*$ splits $T$ into components $A$ and $B$. By the Cut Property, $e^*$ is the cheapest edge crossing this cut. Every other spanning tree must include some edge crossing the cut $(A,B)$, and all such edges cost more than $e^*$. Therefore every other spanning tree has bottleneck $\ge c(e^*)$, so $T$ is also a minimum-bottleneck spanning tree.
