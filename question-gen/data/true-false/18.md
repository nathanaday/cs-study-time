# Question

A directed graph with no directed cycles must be a tree or forest structure with at most $n-1$ edges for $n$ nodes.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Unlike undirected graphs, DAGs can have many edges while still being acyclic. For example, a graph on nodes $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ with an edge $(i,j)$ whenever $i < j$ has $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges and no cycles. DAGs can be richly structured.
