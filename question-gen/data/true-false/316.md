# Question

In a connected undirected graph with distinct edge costs, the cheapest edge in the entire graph must belong to every minimum spanning tree.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Let $e^* = (u,v)$ be the cheapest edge. Consider the cut $S = \{u\}$, $V \setminus S = V \setminus \{u\}$. The edge $e^*$ crosses this cut, and since it is the cheapest edge in the entire graph, it is the cheapest edge crossing this cut. By the Cut Property, $e^*$ belongs to every MST (when edge costs are distinct).
