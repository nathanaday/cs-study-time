# Question

If a directed graph $G$ has a topological ordering, then $G$ must be a DAG.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is statement (3.18). If $G$ contained a cycle $C$, let $v_i$ be the lowest-indexed node on $C$ and $v_j$ be the node just before $v_i$ on the cycle. Then edge $(v_j, v_i)$ exists, but since $v_i$ is lowest-indexed on $C$, we have $j > i$. This edge points backward in the ordering, contradicting the definition of topological ordering.
