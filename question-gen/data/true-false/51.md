# Question

A connected graph $G$ is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd-length cycles.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

The BFS algorithm proves both directions. If $G$ is bipartite, it cannot contain an odd cycle (statement 3.14). Conversely, if $G$ contains no odd cycles, then the BFS coloring succeeds (no intra-layer edges occur), proving $G$ is bipartite. Odd cycles are the only obstruction to bipartiteness.
