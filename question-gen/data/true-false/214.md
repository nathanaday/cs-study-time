# Question

Algorithm A has a running time of $\Theta(n^2)$ and algorithm B has a running time of $\Theta(n \log n)$. From this we can conclude that A can never run faster than B on the same input set.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

$\\Theta$ notation describes asymptotic behavior for sufficiently large $n$. For small values of $n$, algorithm A could run faster than B due to smaller constant factors or lower-order terms. Additionally, if these are worst-case bounds, A might be faster on specific inputs.
