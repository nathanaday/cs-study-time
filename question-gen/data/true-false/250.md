# Question

If path P is the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ and $w$ is a node on the path, then the part of path P from $u$ to $w$ is also the shortest path.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is the optimal substructure property of shortest paths. If the subpath from $u$ to $w$ were not shortest, we could replace it with a shorter path, creating a shorter overall path from $u$ to $v$, contradicting that P is the shortest path.
