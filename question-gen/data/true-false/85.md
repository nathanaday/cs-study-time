# Question

A matching is **stable** if there is no pair $(m, w)$ where both $m$ and $w$ would prefer to be matched with each other over their current partners.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is the definition of stability. An instability (also called a blocking pair) exists when a man $m$ and a woman $w$ are not matched together, yet $m$ prefers $w$ to his current partner and $w$ prefers $m$ to her current partner. A stable matching has no such pairs.
