# Question

MAX-HEAPIFY called on a node that is already larger than both its children terminates in $\Theta(1)$ time without making any recursive calls.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If $A[i]$ is already larger than both its children, then the variable "largest" remains equal to $i$. The condition largest $\ne i$ on line 8 is false, so no swap occurs and no recursive call is made. The procedure terminates immediately in $\Theta(1)$ time.
