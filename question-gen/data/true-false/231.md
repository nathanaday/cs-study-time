# Question

Consider a binary heap with $n$ nodes stored as an array. The parent, left child, and right child of the node with index 11 are at indices 6, 22, and 23 respectively.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

For a 1-indexed binary heap array, the parent of node $i$ is $\\lfloor i/2 \\rfloor$, left child is $2i$, and right child is $2i+1$. For node 11: parent = $\\lfloor 11/2 \\rfloor = 5$, left child = 22, right child = 23. The parent should be 5, not 6. So the statement is false.
