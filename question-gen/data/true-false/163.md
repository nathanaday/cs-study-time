# Question

A Fibonacci Heap extract-min operation has a worst-case run time of $O(\log n)$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The extract-min operation in a Fibonacci Heap has an amortized time of $O(\log n)$, but its worst-case time is $O(n)$ due to the consolidation step that may need to process all trees in the root list.
