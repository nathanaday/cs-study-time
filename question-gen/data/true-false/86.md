# Question

A perfect matching in a set of $n$ men and $n$ women pairs every person with exactly one person of the opposite group, with no one left unmatched.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

A perfect matching requires that every man is paired with exactly one woman and every woman is paired with exactly one man. This is a prerequisite for discussing stability -- we first need a complete matching before we can ask whether it is stable.
