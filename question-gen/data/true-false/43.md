# Question

If a directed graph contains cycles, it cannot have an arborescence.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The original graph $G$ can contain many cycles. An arborescence is a carefully selected subgraph that forms a tree (with no cycles) while still spanning all nodes. We select edges to avoid cycles in the arborescence itself, even though the original graph has cycles.
