# Question

BFS (Breadth-First Search) uses a stack (LIFO) data structure to determine the order in which nodes are explored.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

BFS uses a **queue** (FIFO -- first-in, first-out), which causes it to explore nodes layer by layer. DFS uses a **stack** (LIFO -- last-in, first-out), which causes it to dive deeper before backtracking.
