# Question

Consider a graph with vertices {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} where edges connect: a-b, a-e, a-f, a-g, b-c, b-d, b-e, b-f, c-d, c-g, d-e, d-f, e-f, f-g. This graph is bipartite.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The graph contains odd-length cycles, so it cannot be bipartite. A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd-length cycles.
