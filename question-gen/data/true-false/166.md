# Question

Dijkstra's algorithm will correctly find the shortest path in a graph containing negative edge weights, provided there are no negative cycles.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Dijkstra's algorithm does not work correctly with negative edge weights, even if there are no negative cycles. Dijkstra's relies on the property that once a node is finalized, its shortest distance is determined, which fails with negative edges.
