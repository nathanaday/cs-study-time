# Question

In the minimum cost arborescence algorithm, when we contract a cycle $C$ into a single supernode and recursively solve on the smaller graph, we might lose the optimal arborescence of the original graph.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

A key lemma proves that there always exists an optimal arborescence in the original graph $G$ that has exactly one edge entering the cycle $C$. This optimal arborescence corresponds to an arborescence in the contracted graph $G'$, so the recursive approach is guaranteed to find an optimal solution.
