# Question

A binary max-heap can be built using an unsorted list of elements in $O(n)$ time.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

The bottom-up heap construction algorithm (Floyd's algorithm) builds a heap in $O(n)$ time. It starts from the last non-leaf node and performs sift-down operations. The total work is bounded by $\\sum_{h=0}^{\\lfloor \\log n \\rfloor} \\lceil n/2^{h+1} \\rceil \\cdot O(h) = O(n)$.
