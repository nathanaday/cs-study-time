# Question

In the accounting method, it is acceptable for the total stored credit to temporarily become negative, as long as it is non-negative by the end of the sequence.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The total stored credit must remain non-negative **at all times**, not just at the end. If credit went negative at any point, it would mean the total charges so far are less than the total actual costs so far, which would invalidate the amortized bound for that prefix of the sequence.
