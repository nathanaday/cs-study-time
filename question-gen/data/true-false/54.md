# Question

In the minimum cost arborescence algorithm, after modifying edge costs by subtracting $y_v$ from all edges entering $v$, all edges in the naive greedy set $F^*$ (formed by choosing the cheapest edge entering each node) have modified cost $0$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

For each node $v$, we define $y_v$ as the minimum cost edge entering $v$, and we select that minimum-cost edge for $F^*$. After subtracting $y_v$ from that edge's cost, its modified cost becomes $c'_e = c_e - y_v = 0$.
