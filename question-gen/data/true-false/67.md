# Question

The greedy interval scheduling algorithm (earliest finish time) can be implemented to run in $O(n \log n)$ time for $n$ requests.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Sorting the $n$ requests by finish time takes $O(n \log n)$. After sorting, a single pass through the sorted list selects compatible requests in $O(n)$ time. The total is dominated by the sorting step: $O(n \log n)$.
