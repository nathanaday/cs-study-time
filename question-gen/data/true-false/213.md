# Question

In a connected undirected graph, and using the same starting point, the depth of any DFS tree is at least as much as the depth of any BFS tree.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

BFS produces a tree with minimum depth from the root (shortest paths). DFS explores as deep as possible, and its tree depth is always at least as large as the BFS tree depth. Every BFS level-k node is at distance k from the root, and DFS can only reach it at depth >= k.
