# Question

In the minimum cost arborescence algorithm, if the naive greedy set $F^*$ contains a cycle $C$, that cycle must include the root node $r$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

By definition of an arborescence, no edges can enter the root $r$. Therefore, $r$ cannot be part of any cycle formed by edges that each enter some node. Any cycle in $F^*$ must exist only among non-root nodes.
