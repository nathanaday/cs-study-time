# Question

If a graph $G$ contains an even-length cycle, then $G$ cannot be bipartite.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Even-length cycles can be 2-colored successfully. For example, a 4-cycle with nodes $1, 2, 3, 4$ can be colored: red, blue, red, blue. The alternating coloring works because when we return to node 1, it neighbors node 4 which has the opposite color. Only odd-length cycles prevent bipartiteness.
