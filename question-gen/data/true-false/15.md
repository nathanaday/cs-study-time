# Question

Finding all connected components of an undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes and $m = |E|$ edges by repeatedly running BFS/DFS from unvisited nodes takes $O(m \cdot n)$ total time.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Although BFS/DFS may be invoked multiple times, each node and edge is processed at most once across all invocations. The total running time is $O(m + n)$.
