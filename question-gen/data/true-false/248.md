# Question

If all edges in a connected undirected graph have distinct positive weights, the shortest path between any two vertices is unique.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Distinct edge weights do not guarantee unique shortest paths. Two different paths can have different sets of edges but the same total weight. For example, edges with weights 1, 2, 3: a path using edges of weight 1+2=3 has the same total as a single edge of weight 3.
