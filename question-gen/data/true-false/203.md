# Question

Let $d(u, v)$ denote the minimum distance from node $u$ to node $v$ in a weighted graph G. If $d(s, u) + d(u, t) = d(s, t)$, then $u$ is on at least one shortest path from $s$ to $t$. (All edge weights in G are positive.)

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If $d(s,u) + d(u,t) = d(s,t)$, then the path from $s$ to $u$ (of length $d(s,u)$) followed by the path from $u$ to $t$ (of length $d(u,t)$) has total length equal to $d(s,t)$. This means this combined path is a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ that passes through $u$.
