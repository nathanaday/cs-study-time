# Question

Consider the stable matching problem with $n$ women and $n$ men (where $n \geq 2$). It is not possible, for any preference lists, that the Gale-Shapley algorithm with men proposing can match every woman to her least preferred man.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

It is possible. If every man's first preference in women is unique and for that particular woman, the corresponding man is her least preferred man, then each man proposes to his top choice and is immediately accepted, matching every woman to her least preferred man.

For example with $n = 2$: M1: W1 > W2, M2: W2 > W1, W1: M2 > M1, W2: M1 > M2. M1 proposes to W1 and she accepts. M2 proposes to W2 and she accepts. Both women end up with their least preferred man.
