# Question

If the input to HEAPSORT is already sorted in decreasing order, HEAPSORT runs in $O(n)$ time because the array is already a valid max-heap.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

While a decreasing-order array is already a valid max-heap (so BUILD-MAX-HEAP does $O(n)$ work with minimal rearrangement), HEAPSORT still must extract the maximum element $n-1$ times, calling MAX-HEAPIFY after each extraction. Each MAX-HEAPIFY call takes $O(\lg n)$ in the worst case, so the total is still $O(n \lg n)$.
