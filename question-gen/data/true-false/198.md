# Question

Inserting into a binomial heap of $n$ elements has $O(1)$ amortized cost.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

While a single insertion into a binomial heap can take $O(\log n)$ worst-case time due to cascading merges of binomial trees, the amortized cost over a sequence of insertions is $O(1)$, analogous to incrementing a binary counter.
