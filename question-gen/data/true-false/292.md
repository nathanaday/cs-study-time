# Question

If man $m$ and woman $w$ rank each other first in an instance of the Stable Matching Problem, then every stable matching for this instance must contain the pair $(m, w)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If $m$ and $w$ rank each other first, then in any stable matching $S$ where they are not paired, $m$ prefers $w$ to his partner and $w$ prefers $m$ to her partner, forming an instability. This contradicts $S$ being stable. Therefore every stable matching must contain $(m, w)$.
