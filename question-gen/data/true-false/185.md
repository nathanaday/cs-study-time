# Question

If Algorithm $A$ has a worst-case running time of $\Theta(2^n)$ and algorithm $B$ has a worst-case running time of $\Theta(n^2)$, then Algorithm $B$ always runs faster than algorithm $A$ on any given input.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Worst-case running time describes the maximum time over all inputs of a given size, not the time on every input. Algorithm A could run in $O(1)$ on some inputs (best case) while Algorithm B runs in $\Theta(n^2)$ on those same inputs. So B does not always run faster than A on any given input.
