# Question

The optimal greedy rule for minimizing maximum lateness is to schedule jobs in order of increasing deadlines (earliest deadline first).

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Earliest Deadline First orders jobs so that $d_1 \leq d_2 \leq \ldots \leq d_n$ and schedules them consecutively. While this rule ignores job durations entirely, it is proven optimal via an exchange argument.
