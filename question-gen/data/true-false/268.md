# Question

The worst-case running time of MAX-HEAPIFY on a heap of $n$ elements is $\Theta(\lg n)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

The worst case occurs when the element sinks all the way from the root to a leaf, traversing the full height of the tree. Since the height is $\lfloor \lg n \rfloor$, this takes $\Theta(\lg n)$ time. A concrete worst-case example: place the smallest value at the root of a heap where all other nodes have a larger value, forcing it to sink through every level.
