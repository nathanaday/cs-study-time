# Question

BUILD-MAX-HEAP$'$ (building a heap by repeated insertion) has a worst-case running time of $\Theta(n \lg n)$, which is worse than BUILD-MAX-HEAP's $O(n)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

BUILD-MAX-HEAP$'$ calls MAX-HEAP-INSERT $n$ times. The $i$-th insertion operates on a heap of size $i-1$ and takes $O(\lg i)$ time. The total is $\sum_{i=1}^{n} O(\lg i) = O(\lg(n!)) = O(n \lg n)$. In the worst case (e.g., inserting in increasing order), each element bubbles up the full height, giving $\Theta(n \lg n)$. This is asymptotically worse than BUILD-MAX-HEAP's $O(n)$.
