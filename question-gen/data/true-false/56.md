# Question

The greedy rule of always selecting the available request with the earliest start time $s(i)$ produces an optimal solution for the interval scheduling problem.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Selecting the earliest start time can fail badly. If the earliest request spans a very long interval, accepting it may force us to reject many shorter requests. In the worst case, the earliest request covers the entire timeline, so the greedy method accepts 1 request while the optimal solution accepts many.
