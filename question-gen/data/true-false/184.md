# Question

In a binary heap, the decrease-key operation has a worst-case time complexity of $O(\log n)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

In a binary heap, decrease-key reduces a key value and then percolates the element up (bubble-up) to restore the heap property. In the worst case, the element bubbles all the way to the root, traversing $O(\log n)$ levels.
