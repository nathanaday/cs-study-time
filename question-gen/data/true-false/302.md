# Question

If $f(n) = O(g(n))$, then $f(n)^2 = O(g(n)^2)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Since $f(n) = O(g(n))$, there exist $c > 0$ and $n_0$ such that $f(n) \le c \cdot g(n)$ for all $n \ge n_0$. Squaring both sides (both functions are nonneg): $f(n)^2 \le c^2 \cdot g(n)^2$ for all $n \ge n_0$. This shows $f(n)^2 = O(g(n)^2)$ with constant $c^2$.
