# Question

In the Gale-Shapley algorithm with men proposing, it is possible for a woman to receive a more preferred partner by swapping two men's positions in her preference list. A partner is "more preferred" if it is ranked higher than the initially assigned partner before the swapping.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Consider three women W1, W2, W3 and three men M1, M2, M3 with preferences:
W1: M1, M2, M3; W2: M1, M2, M3; W3: M2, M1, M3
M1: W3, W1, W2; M2: W1, W3, W2; M3: W3, W1, W2

Running Gale-Shapley with true preferences yields pairs (M1, W3), (M2, W1), (M3, W2), so W3 is matched with M1, her second choice.

Now if W3 falsely reports her preferences as W3': M2, M3, M1 (swapping M3 and M1), the algorithm produces:
M1 proposes to W3, she accepts. M2 proposes to W1, she accepts. M3 proposes to W3, she accepts (per W3', prefers M3 over M1), M1 is freed. M1 proposes to W1, she accepts (prefers M1), M2 is freed. M2 proposes to W3, she accepts (per W3', prefers M2 over M3), M3 is freed. M3 proposes to W2, she accepts. Final: (M1, W1), (M2, W3), (M3, W2). W3 now gets M2, her true first choice. By swapping two men in her list, she obtained a more preferred partner.
