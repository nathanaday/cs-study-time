# Question

An in-order traversal of a min-heap outputs the values in sorted order.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

A min-heap only guarantees that each parent is smaller than its children. It does not maintain a sorted order across siblings or between left and right subtrees. An in-order traversal of a min-heap does not produce sorted output. For example, in a min-heap [1, 3, 2], in-order traversal gives 3, 1, 2 which is not sorted.
