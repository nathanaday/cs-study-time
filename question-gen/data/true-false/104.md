# Question

In the exchange argument proof for minimizing lateness, an **inversion** is defined as a pair of adjacent jobs where a job with a later deadline is scheduled before a job with an earlier deadline.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

An inversion is any pair of jobs (not necessarily adjacent) where a job $i$ with deadline $d_i$ is scheduled before job $j$ with $d_j < d_i$. However, a key step in the proof (part a of 4.9) shows that if any inversion exists, there must also be an adjacent inverted pair, which is what we actually swap.
