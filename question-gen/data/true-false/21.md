# Question

A topological ordering of a directed graph $G$ is an ordering of nodes $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ such that for every edge $(v_i, v_j)$, we have $i < j$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is the definition of topological ordering. All edges must point "forward" in the ordering -- from a lower-indexed node to a higher-indexed node. Visually, this means arranging nodes in a line so every edge goes left to right.
