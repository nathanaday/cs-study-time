# Question

Consider an instance of the Stable Matching Problem in which there exists a man $m$ and a woman $w$ such that $m$ is ranked first on the preference list of $w$ and $w$ is ranked first on the preference list of $m$. In every stable matching for this instance, $m$ is matched with $w$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Suppose $S$ is a stable matching that contains the pairs $(m, w_0)$ and $(m_0, w)$, for some $m_0 \neq m$ and $w_0 \neq w$. Clearly, the pairing $(m, w)$ is preferred by both $m$ and $w$ over their current pairings (since each ranks the other first), contradicting the stability of $S$. Therefore $m$ must be matched with $w$ in every stable matching.
