# Question

Consider a version of the interval scheduling problem where all intervals are of the same size. A greedy algorithm based on earliest start time will always select the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

When all intervals have the same length, sorting by earliest start time is equivalent to sorting by earliest finish time (since finish = start + constant length). The earliest-finish-time greedy algorithm is known to be optimal for interval scheduling, so earliest start time also works when intervals are equal-sized.
