# Question

The number of binomial trees in a binomial heap with $n$ elements is at most $O(\log n)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

A binomial heap with $n$ elements has one binomial tree for each 1-bit in the binary representation of $n$. Since $n$ has at most $\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor + 1$ bits, the number of binomial trees is at most $O(\\log n)$.
