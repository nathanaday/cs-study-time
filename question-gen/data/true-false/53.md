# Question

In the interval scheduling problem, a subset of requests is called **compatible** if no two requests in the subset overlap in time.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Compatibility means that no two selected intervals share any point in time. The goal of interval scheduling is to find a compatible subset of maximum size -- that is, schedule as many non-overlapping requests as possible.
