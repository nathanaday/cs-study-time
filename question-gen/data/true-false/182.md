# Question

Suppose we have functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ that take positive values for all $n$. Then, it is possible that neither $f(n) = O(g(n))$ nor $g(n) = O(f(n))$ holds true.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Two functions can be asymptotically incomparable. For example, $f(n) = n$ for even $n$ and $n^2$ for odd $n$, and $g(n) = n^2$ for even $n$ and $n$ for odd $n$. Neither dominates the other asymptotically.
