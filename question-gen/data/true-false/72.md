# Question

The strong component containing node $s$ can be computed by finding the intersection of nodes reached by BFS from $s$ in $G$ and BFS from $s$ in $G^{rev}$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

BFS from $s$ in $G$ finds all nodes that $s$ can reach. BFS from $s$ in $G^{rev}$ finds all nodes that can reach $s$. The intersection is exactly the set of nodes that are mutually reachable with $s$, which is the definition of $s$'s strong component.
