# Question

The greedy algorithm for interval partitioning sorts intervals by their finish times.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The greedy algorithm for interval partitioning sorts intervals by their **start times**. It then sweeps through the intervals in this order, assigning each interval a label (resource) that does not conflict with any overlapping interval that was already assigned. This is different from interval scheduling, which sorts by finish time.
