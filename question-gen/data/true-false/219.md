# Question

Function $f(n) = 5n^2 4^n + 6n^4 3^n$ is $O(n^4 3^n)$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The dominant term is $5n^2 4^n$ because $4^n$ grows exponentially faster than $3^n$. So $f(n) = \\Theta(n^2 4^n)$, which is not $O(n^4 3^n)$. The exponential base matters more than the polynomial factor: $n^2 4^n$ grows faster than $n^4 3^n$ for large $n$.
