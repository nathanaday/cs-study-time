# Question

Mutual reachability is a transitive relation: if $u$ and $v$ are mutually reachable, and $v$ and $w$ are mutually reachable, then $u$ and $w$ are mutually reachable.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is statement (3.16). To reach $w$ from $u$: follow the path from $u$ to $v$, then from $v$ to $w$. To reach $u$ from $w$: follow the path from $w$ to $v$, then from $v$ to $u$. Path concatenation guarantees mutual reachability between $u$ and $w$.
