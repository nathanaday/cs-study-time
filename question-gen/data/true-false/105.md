# Question

Swapping an adjacent inverted pair of jobs in a schedule cannot increase the maximum lateness.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By part (c) of statement (4.9), when we swap adjacent jobs $i$ and $j$ where $d_i > d_j$, job $j$ finishes earlier (lateness can only decrease), and job $i$'s new lateness is strictly less than $j$'s old lateness (because $d_i > d_j$). Since $j$'s old lateness was at most the old maximum, the swap does not create a new maximum.
