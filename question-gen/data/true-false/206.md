# Question

The solution of the recurrence $T(n) = 18T(n/3) + O(n^3)$ is $T(n) = O(n^3)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By the Master Theorem: $a = 18, b = 3$, so $n^{\\log_b a} = n^{\\log_3 18} \\approx n^{2.63}$. Since $f(n) = O(n^3) = \\Omega(n^{\\log_3 18 + \\epsilon})$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$, this is Case 3. The regularity condition holds, so $T(n) = \\Theta(n^3) = O(n^3)$.
