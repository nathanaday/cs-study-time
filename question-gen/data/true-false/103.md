# Question

Two schedules that both have no inversions and no idle time can have different maximum lateness values.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

By statement (4.8), all schedules with no inversions and no idle time have the **same** maximum lateness. Schedules without inversions can only differ in the ordering of jobs with identical deadlines. Since those jobs share a deadline and together occupy the same time block, the last one to finish always determines the same lateness regardless of internal ordering.
