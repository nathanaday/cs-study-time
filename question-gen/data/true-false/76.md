# Question

A spanning tree of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a subgraph that includes all vertices of $G$, is connected, and contains no cycles.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

A spanning tree must satisfy three properties: it includes every vertex in $V$, it is connected (there is a path between any two vertices), and it is acyclic (it contains no cycles). These properties together ensure the subgraph is a tree that "spans" all vertices.
