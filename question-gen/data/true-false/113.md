# Question

Consider the stable matching problem with $n$ women and $n$ men (where $n \geq 2$). Suppose the preference lists are such that for any woman $w$, her most preferred man $m$ does not have $w$ as his first preference. It is possible that the Gale-Shapley algorithm with men proposing can match every woman to her most preferred man.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Consider this example with 3 women and 3 men:
W1: M1 > M3 > M2, W2: M2 > M1 > M3, W3: M3 > M1 > M2
M1: W2 > W1 > W3, M2: W1 > W2 > W3, M3: W1 > W3 > W2

Running Gale-Shapley with men proposing:
M1 proposes to W2, she accepts. M2 proposes to W1, she accepts. M3 proposes to W1, she accepts (prefers M3's rank? No -- let's trace correctly). Actually: M1 proposes to W2 (his top), she accepts. M2 proposes to W1, she accepts. M3 proposes to W1, she rejects (prefers M2 currently? No, W1's list is M1 > M3 > M2, so W1 prefers M3 over M2). W1 drops M2, accepts M3. M2 proposes to W2, she drops M1 (W2 prefers M2 over M1? W2's list: M2 > M1 > M3, yes). M1 proposes to W1, she accepts (prefers M1 over M3). M3 proposes to W3, she accepts. Final matching: (M1, W1), (M2, W2), (M3, W3). Every woman gets her most preferred man, even though no woman's top man had her as his first preference.
