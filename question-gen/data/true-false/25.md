# Question

The general component-growing algorithm -- starting with $R = \{s\}$ and repeatedly adding a node $v \notin R$ adjacent to some $u \in R$ -- will produce the connected component of $s$ regardless of which valid edge $(u, v)$ is chosen at each step.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By theorem (3.5), the set $R$ at termination is exactly the connected component containing $s$. The proof relies on two invariants: every node added to $R$ is reachable from $s$, and if any reachable node were missing, the algorithm would not have stopped. These hold regardless of edge selection order. BFS and DFS are both specific orderings of this general strategy.
