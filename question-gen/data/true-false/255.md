# Question

The depths of any two leaves in a binomial heap differ by at most 1.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

A binomial heap consists of multiple binomial trees. A binomial tree $B_k$ has height $k$. If the heap contains both $B_0$ (height 0, leaf at depth 0) and $B_k$ for large $k$ (leaves at depth $k$), the depths can differ by much more than 1.
