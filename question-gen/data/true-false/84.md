# Question

The greedy algorithm for interval partitioning always assigns every interval a label, and the number of labels used equals the depth of the interval set.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By statement (4.5), every interval receives a label and no two overlapping intervals share a label. Since the algorithm uses $d$ labels (where $d$ is the depth), and by (4.4) at least $d$ resources are needed, the algorithm achieves the optimal number of resources (statement 4.6).
