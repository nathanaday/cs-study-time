# Question

If all the edge weights in a connected graph are distinct, then the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph is guaranteed to be unique.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

When all edge weights are distinct, the MST is unique. This follows from the cut property and cycle property of MSTs: with distinct weights, each cut has a unique lightest edge, and each cycle has a unique heaviest edge, leading to a unique MST.
