# Question

A connected graph with distinct edge costs has a unique minimum spanning tree.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Suppose $T_1$ and $T_2$ are distinct MSTs. Take edge $e \in T_1 \setminus T_2$. Adding $e$ to $T_2$ creates a cycle $C$ containing an edge $e' \in T_2 \setminus T_1$. Since costs are distinct, either $c(e) < c(e')$ or $c(e) > c(e')$. In either case, we can swap edges to get a cheaper spanning tree, contradicting that both are MSTs.
