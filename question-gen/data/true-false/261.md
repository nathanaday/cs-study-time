# Question

A heap of height $h$ has at least $2^h$ elements.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

A heap of height $h$ has at least one node at level $h$ and is complete up to level $h-1$, giving at minimum $1 + 2 + 4 + \ldots + 2^{h-1} + 1 = 2^h$ elements. At maximum (when the tree is complete), it has $2^{h+1} - 1$ elements.
