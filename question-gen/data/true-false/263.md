# Question

In a max-heap, the smallest element must reside at a leaf node.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

In a max-heap, every parent node is at least as large as its children. Therefore, the smallest element cannot have any children (otherwise it would violate the max-heap property), so it must be a leaf. Leaves occupy indices $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 1$ through $n$ in the array representation.
