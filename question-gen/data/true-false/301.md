# Question

If $f(n) = O(g(n))$, then $2^{f(n)} = O(2^{g(n)})$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Let $f(n) = 2n$ and $g(n) = n$. Then $f(n) = O(g(n))$ with constant $c = 2$. But $2^{f(n)} = 2^{2n} = 4^n$ and $2^{g(n)} = 2^n$. For $4^n = O(2^n)$ we would need $2^n \le c$ for some constant $c$ and large $n$, which is impossible. Exponentiation can amplify constant multiplicative differences into exponential gaps.
