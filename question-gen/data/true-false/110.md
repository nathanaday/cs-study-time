# Question

In an exchange argument proof, an inversion is always defined relative to the property that the greedy algorithm sorts by.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If the greedy algorithm sorts by deadline, an inversion is a violation of deadline order. If it sorts by finish time, an inversion is a violation of finish time order. The inversion captures exactly where a candidate solution deviates from the greedy ordering, and the proof shows each such deviation can be fixed without penalty.
