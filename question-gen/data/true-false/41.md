# Question

A graph $G$ is bipartite if and only if its nodes can be colored using two colors such that every edge connects nodes of different colors.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is the definition of a bipartite graph. A graph is bipartite when we can partition its vertices into two sets $X$ and $Y$ such that every edge connects a vertex in $X$ to a vertex in $Y$. This is equivalent to a valid 2-coloring where adjacent vertices have different colors.
