# Question

The lateness $l_i$ of a job can be negative if the job finishes well before its deadline.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Lateness is defined as $l_i = f(i) - d_i$ only when $f(i) > d_i$ (the job finishes after its deadline). If the job finishes on time or early, its lateness is defined to be $l_i = 0$. Lateness is never negative.
