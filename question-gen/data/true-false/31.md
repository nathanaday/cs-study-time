# Question

DFS on a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n = |V|$ nodes and $m = |E|$ edges, given in adjacency list representation, runs in $O(m + n)$ time.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Each time a node $u$ with degree $n_u$ is explored, $n_u$ nodes are pushed onto the stack. Total pushes across all nodes is $\sum_{v \in V} n_v = 2m$. Each push and pop is $O(1)$, giving $O(m)$ for stack operations plus $O(n)$ for setup, totaling $O(m + n)$.
