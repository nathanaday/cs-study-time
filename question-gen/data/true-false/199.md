# Question

In an undirected, connected, weighted graph with at least three vertices and unique edge weights, the heaviest edge in the graph cannot be in any minimum spanning tree.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

If the heaviest edge is a bridge (its removal disconnects the graph), then it must be in every spanning tree, including the MST. The heaviest edge can only be excluded from the MST if it is the heaviest edge on some cycle.
