# Question

In Fibonacci heaps, the decrease-key operation has an amortized cost of $O(1)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

One of the key advantages of Fibonacci heaps over binary heaps and binomial heaps is that decrease-key has $O(1)$ amortized time complexity. This is achieved through the cascading cut mechanism and the potential function analysis.
