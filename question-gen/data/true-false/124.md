# Question

Consider an instance of the Stable Matching Problem in which there exists a man $m$ and a woman $w$ such that $m$ is ranked first on the preference list of $w$ and $w$ is ranked first on the preference list of $m$. In every stable matching for this instance, $m$ is matched with $w$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Suppose for contradiction that a stable matching $S$ exists where $m$ is matched with $w_0 \neq w$ and $w$ is matched with $m_0 \neq m$. Since $w$ ranks $m$ first, she prefers $m$ over her current partner $m_0$. Since $m$ ranks $w$ first, he prefers $w$ over his current partner $w_0$. Both $m$ and $w$ prefer each other over their assigned partners, forming a blocking pair. This contradicts the stability of $S$.
