# Question

The optimality of the greedy interval scheduling algorithm (statement 4.3) is proven by induction.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The "greedy stays ahead" property (4.2) is proven by induction, but the optimality (4.3) is proven by **contradiction**. The proof assumes the optimal set $O$ has more requests than the greedy set $A$ (i.e., $m > k$). Using (4.2), this implies the existence of a request $j_{k+1}$ compatible with $A$'s last interval, contradicting the fact that the algorithm would have selected it.
