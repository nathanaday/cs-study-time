# Question

Dijkstra's algorithm can correctly output the shortest path in graphs with negative edge weights as long as there are no negative cycles.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Dijkstra's algorithm does not work correctly with negative edge weights, even if there are no negative cycles. The algorithm relies on the greedy property that once a vertex is extracted from the priority queue, its shortest distance is finalized. Negative edges can violate this property.
