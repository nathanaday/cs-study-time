# Question

In a $d$-ary heap, EXTRACT-MAX runs in $O(d \log_d n)$ time while INSERT runs in $O(\log_d n)$ time, so increasing $d$ improves insertions at the cost of slower extractions.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

In a $d$-ary heap, the height is $\Theta(\log_d n)$. EXTRACT-MAX must compare with all $d$ children at each level as it sinks down, giving $O(d \log_d n)$. INSERT only compares with one parent at each level as it bubbles up, giving $O(\log_d n)$. Larger $d$ reduces the height (benefiting insertions) but increases per-level work for extractions.
