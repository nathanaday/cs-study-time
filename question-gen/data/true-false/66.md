# Question

To test if a directed graph $G$ is strongly connected, it suffices to pick any node $s$, run BFS from $s$ in $G$, and verify that all nodes are reached.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

This only verifies that $s$ can reach all nodes, not that all nodes can reach $s$. We must run BFS from $s$ in both $G$ and $G^{rev}$. If both searches reach all $n$ nodes, then $s$ is mutually reachable with every node, which by transitivity (3.16) implies the graph is strongly connected.
