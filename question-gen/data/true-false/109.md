# Question

The "greedy stays ahead" proof technique and the "exchange argument" proof technique are two approaches for proving that a greedy algorithm produces an optimal solution.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

"Greedy stays ahead" (via induction) compares the greedy solution to any optimal solution step by step, showing the greedy is at least as good at each stage. The "exchange argument" takes any optimal solution and shows it can be gradually transformed into the greedy solution without losing optimality. Both prove optimality but suit different problem structures.
