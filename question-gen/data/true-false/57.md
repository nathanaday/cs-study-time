# Question

The BFS-based bipartite testing algorithm can identify a specific odd cycle when the graph is not bipartite.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

When an intra-layer edge $(x, y)$ is found in layer $L_j$, the algorithm can construct an explicit odd cycle by finding the lowest common ancestor $z$ of $x$ and $y$ in the BFS tree, then forming the cycle: path from $z$ to $x$, edge $(x,y)$, path from $y$ to $z$. This cycle has length $2(j-i) + 1$, which is odd.
