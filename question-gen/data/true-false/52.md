# Question

If a disconnected graph has three connected components, the BFS-based bipartite test must be run three separate times, once for each component.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

BFS only explores nodes reachable from the starting node $s$, which means it only covers one connected component. To test if a disconnected graph is bipartite, we must run BFS from a starting node in each connected component and verify that each component is individually bipartite. The graph is bipartite only if all components are bipartite.
