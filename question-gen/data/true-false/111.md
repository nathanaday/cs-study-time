# Question

In an exchange argument, the goal is to show that the greedy solution is the only optimal solution.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The goal is to show that the greedy solution is **among** the optimal solutions, not that it is the only one. The argument works by taking any optimal solution and transforming it into the greedy solution via a sequence of swaps that preserve (or improve) quality. Multiple distinct optimal solutions may exist.
