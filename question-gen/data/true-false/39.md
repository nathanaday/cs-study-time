# Question

DFS trees tend to be wide and shallow, with short root-to-leaf paths, reflecting the algorithm's layer-by-layer exploration.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

DFS trees tend to be **narrow and deep**, with long root-to-leaf paths, reflecting the algorithm's tendency to plunge as deep as possible before backtracking. It is BFS trees that tend to be wide and shallow due to layer-by-layer exploration.
