# Question

In the Gale-Shapley algorithm with men proposing, it is possible for a woman to receive a more preferred partner by swapping two men's positions in her preference list. A partner is "more preferred" if it is ranked higher than the initially assigned partner before the swapping.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Consider three women and men with preferences: W1: M1, M2, M3; W2: M1, M2, M3; W3: M2, M1, M3; M1: W3, W1, W2; M2: W1, W3, W2; M3: W3, W1, W2. Running GS on true preferences produces pairs (M1,W3), (M2,W1), (M3,W2), giving W3 her second choice M1. If W3 falsely swaps to pretend she prefers M3 over M1 (list: M2, M3, M1), re-running GS yields (M1,W1), (M2,W3), (M3,W2). Now W3 gets M2, who is her true first choice. By strategically misreporting, a woman can improve her outcome.
