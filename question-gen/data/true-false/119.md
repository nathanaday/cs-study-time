# Question

Consider a stable roommate problem involving four students (A, B, C, D): Each student ranks the other three in a strict order of preference. A matching involves forming two pairs of the students, and it is considered stable if no two separated (not matched) students would prefer each other over their current roommates. A stable matching always exists in this scenario.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

A stable matching need not exist. Consider the following preferences where A, B, and C all prefer D the least:
A: B > C > D
B: C > A > D
C: A > B > D
D: A > B > C

There are only 3 possible matchings:
- (A, B) and (C, D): Unstable because C prefers B over D and B prefers C over A.
- (A, C) and (B, D): Unstable because B prefers A over D and A prefers B over C.
- (A, D) and (B, C): Unstable because A prefers C over D and C prefers A over B.

Every matching is unstable, so no stable matching exists for this instance.
