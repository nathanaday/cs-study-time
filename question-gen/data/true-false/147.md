# Question

Suppose that $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ are two positive non-decreasing functions such that $f(n) = O(g(n))$. Then $2^{f(n)} = O(2^{g(n)})$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Counterexample: Let $f(n) = 2n$ and $g(n) = n$. Then $f(n) = O(g(n))$ holds (with constant $c = 2$). But $2^{f(n)} = 2^{2n} = 4^n$ and $2^{g(n)} = 2^n$. For $4^n = O(2^n)$ to hold, we would need a constant $c$ such that $4^n \leq c \cdot 2^n$, i.e., $2^n \leq c$, which is impossible for large $n$. So $2^{f(n)} \neq O(2^{g(n)})$.
