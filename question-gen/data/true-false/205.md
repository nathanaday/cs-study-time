# Question

The divide and conquer algorithm to solve the closest pair of points in 2D runs in $O(n \\log n)$. But if the two lists of points, one sorted by X-coordinate and the other sorted by Y-coordinate, are given to us as input, the rest of the algorithm (skipping the sorting steps) runs in $O(n)$ time.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Even with pre-sorted lists, the closest pair algorithm still requires $O(n \\log n)$ time. The recurrence is $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)$ (the merge step takes linear time), which solves to $T(n) = O(n \\log n)$ by the Master Theorem. The sorting is not the bottleneck.
