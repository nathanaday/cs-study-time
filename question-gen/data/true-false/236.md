# Question

A directed graph G is strongly connected if and only if G with its edge directions reversed is strongly connected.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If G is strongly connected, there is a path from every vertex $u$ to every vertex $v$. Reversing all edges, the path from $u$ to $v$ in G becomes a path from $v$ to $u$ in the reversed graph. So for any two vertices, paths exist in both directions in the reversed graph, making it strongly connected. The converse follows by symmetry.
