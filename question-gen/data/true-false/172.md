# Question

When using the accounting method to find amortized costs for operations A, B, and C on data structure S, it is possible for all operations to end up with the same amortized cost even if their worst-case costs are different.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

In the accounting method, you assign amortized costs to operations such that the total amortized cost is an upper bound on the total actual cost. The amortized costs can be chosen freely as long as the credit invariant is maintained, so it is possible for different operations to receive the same amortized cost regardless of their individual worst-case costs.
