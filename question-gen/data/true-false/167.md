# Question

When performing DFS and BFS starting from a node $u$ in a graph $G$, the number of levels in the DFS tree can never exceed the number of levels in the BFS tree.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The DFS tree can have more levels (be deeper) than the BFS tree. BFS explores level by level, producing a tree with the minimum number of levels (shortest paths from the root). DFS can follow long paths, producing much deeper trees.
