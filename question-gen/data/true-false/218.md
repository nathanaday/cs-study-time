# Question

Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm can be used to find shortest path in graphs with any edge weights.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Dijkstra's algorithm requires all edge weights to be non-negative. With negative edge weights, the algorithm can produce incorrect results because it assumes that once a node is finalized (extracted from the priority queue), its shortest distance is determined, which is not true with negative edges.
