# Question

The Gale-Shapley algorithm terminates after at most $n^2$ iterations, where $n$ is the number of men (or women).

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Each iteration consists of some man proposing to a woman he has never proposed to before. Since there are $n$ men and $n$ women, there are at most $n^2$ possible (man, woman) pairs. Each pair can be proposed at most once, so the algorithm terminates after at most $n^2$ iterations (statement 1.3).
