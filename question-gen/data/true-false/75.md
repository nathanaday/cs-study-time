# Question

The **depth** of a set of intervals is the maximum number of intervals that overlap at any single point in time.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If at some point in time $d$ intervals are all active simultaneously, then we need at least $d$ resources at that moment. The depth is the maximum such overlap across the entire timeline.
