# Question

BFS uses a queue (FIFO) data structure, which ensures that all nodes at distance $j$ from the source are processed before any node at distance $j + 1$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

The FIFO property of a queue guarantees that nodes discovered earlier (closer layers) are processed first. Nodes in layer $L_j$ are all enqueued before nodes in $L_{j+1}$, so they are all dequeued and processed first as well.
