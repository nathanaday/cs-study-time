# Question

In DFS on an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, if $(x, y)$ is a non-tree edge (an edge in $G$ but not in the DFS tree $T$), then one of $x$ or $y$ must be an ancestor of the other in $T$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By theorem (3.7), when DFS examines a non-tree edge $(x, y)$, the other endpoint was discovered during the recursive call of the first. By (3.6), this makes the later-discovered node a descendant of the earlier one. Thus non-tree edges in DFS are always **ancestor-descendant** (vertical) connections.
