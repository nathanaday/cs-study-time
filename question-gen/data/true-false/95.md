# Question

In the Gale-Shapley algorithm with men proposing, each woman is paired with her worst valid partner.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By statement (1.8), each woman receives her worst valid partner. Since men are getting their best valid partners, there is no room for women to do better. Any attempt to construct a stable matching where some woman does better would create an instability, because her partner in $S^*$ would prefer to return to her.
