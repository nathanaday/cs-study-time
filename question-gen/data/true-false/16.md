# Question

A directed graph is **strongly connected** if for every pair of nodes $u$ and $v$, there exists a directed path from $u$ to $v$ and a directed path from $v$ to $u$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Strong connectivity requires bidirectional reachability between every pair of nodes, respecting edge directions. This is a stricter condition than undirected connectivity, where a single path suffices due to edge symmetry.
