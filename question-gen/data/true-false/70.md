# Question

The "greedy stays ahead" property for interval scheduling means that the $r^{th}$ interval selected by the greedy algorithm finishes no later than the $r^{th}$ interval in any optimal solution, i.e., $f(i_r) \leq f(j_r)$ for all $r$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is statement (4.2), proven by induction. The base case ($r = 1$) holds because the greedy algorithm picks the earliest finish time. The inductive step shows that if greedy stays ahead at step $r - 1$, it must also stay ahead at step $r$, since the greedy algorithm would always select the earlier-finishing option among compatible choices.
