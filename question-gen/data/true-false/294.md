# Question

In the Stable Matching Problem with ties allowed, there always exists a perfect matching with no weak instability (where a weak instability requires one person to strictly prefer and the other to be at least indifferent).

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Consider $n=2$ where both men rank $w_1$ first and $w_2$ second (strict), while both women are indifferent between the two men. In matching $\{(m_1,w_1),(m_2,w_2)\}$, $m_2$ strictly prefers $w_1$ and $w_1$ is indifferent -- a weak instability. In $\{(m_1,w_2),(m_2,w_1)\}$, $m_1$ strictly prefers $w_1$ and $w_1$ is indifferent -- also a weak instability. No weakly stable matching exists.
