# Question

Given a spanning tree $T$ where every edge $e \in T$ belongs to some MST of $G$ (edge costs may not be distinct), $T$ must itself be an MST.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Consider four nodes in a cycle: $c(a,b)=1$, $c(b,c)=2$, $c(c,d)=1$, $c(a,d)=2$. MST 1: $\{(a,b),(c,d),(b,c)\}$ cost 4. MST 2: $\{(a,b),(c,d),(a,d)\}$ cost 4. Tree $T = \{(a,b),(b,c),(a,d)\}$ has cost 5, not an MST. But each edge of $T$ appears in some MST: $(a,b)$ in both, $(b,c)$ in MST 1, $(a,d)$ in MST 2.
