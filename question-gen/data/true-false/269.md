# Question

BUILD-MAX-HEAP processes nodes from index 1 up to $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$, calling MAX-HEAPIFY on each.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

BUILD-MAX-HEAP processes nodes in the reverse order: from index $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ down to 1. This bottom-up ordering is essential because MAX-HEAPIFY requires the subtrees rooted at LEFT$(i)$ and RIGHT$(i)$ to already be valid max-heaps. By processing in decreasing order, children are always fixed before their parents.
