# Question

Any function that is $\Omega(\log n)$ is also $\Omega(\log \log n)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If $f(n) = \Omega(\log n)$, then $f(n) \geq c \cdot \log n$ for some constant $c > 0$ and sufficiently large $n$. Since $\log n \geq \log \log n$ for sufficiently large $n$, we have $f(n) \geq c \cdot \log \log n$, so $f(n) = \Omega(\log \log n)$.
