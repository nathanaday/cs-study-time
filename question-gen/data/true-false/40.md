# Question

An arborescence (a directed spanning tree rooted at some node $r$) must have exactly one edge entering each node except the root.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By definition, an arborescence has exactly one incoming edge for each non-root node and zero incoming edges for the root. This structure ensures there's a unique directed path from the root to every other node.
