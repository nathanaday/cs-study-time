# Question

From the BFS property, every edge in a graph either connects two nodes in the same layer or connects nodes in adjacent layers.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is a fundamental property of BFS layering (fact 3.4 referenced in the text). BFS assigns each node to a layer based on its shortest path distance from the source. Since edges can only increase distance by at most 1, no edge can "skip" layers -- every edge connects nodes whose layers differ by at most 1.
