# Question

Given a graph, suppose we have calculated the shortest path from a source to all other vertices. If we modify the graph such that weights of all edges are doubled, then the shortest path remains the same, only the total weight of the path changes.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Doubling all edge weights multiplies the total weight of every path by 2. If path P was shorter than path Q before doubling ($w(P) < w(Q)$), then $2w(P) < 2w(Q)$ after doubling. So the relative ordering of path weights is preserved, and the shortest path remains the same.
