# Question

Consider a stable roommate problem involving four students (A, B, C, D) where each student ranks the other three in strict order of preference. A matching involves forming two pairs, and is stable if no two separated students prefer each other over their current roommates. A stable matching always exists in this scenario.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

A stable matching need not exist. Consider: A: B>C>D, B: C>A>D, C: A>B>D, D: A>B>C. Note A, B, and C all rank D last. Check all 3 possible matchings: (A,B)+(C,D) is unstable because C prefers B over D and B prefers C over A. (A,C)+(B,D) is unstable because B prefers A over D and A prefers B over C. (A,D)+(B,C) is unstable because A prefers C over D and C prefers A over B. Every possible matching is unstable, so no stable matching exists.
