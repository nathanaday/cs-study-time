# Question

Consider an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with distinct nonneg edge weights $w_e \geq 0$. Suppose you have computed a minimum spanning tree $T$ of $G$. Now suppose each edge weight is increased by 1 (the new weights are $c'_e = c_e + 1$). The minimum spanning tree does not change.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Since we are adding the same constant (1) to all edge weights, the relative order of edges by weight does not change. Kruskal's algorithm, for example, processes edges in order of increasing weight. Since the ordering is preserved, Kruskal's picks exactly the same edges in the same order, producing the same MST. More generally, any MST algorithm based on comparing edge weights will make identical decisions since $c_e < c_f$ if and only if $c_e + 1 < c_f + 1$.
