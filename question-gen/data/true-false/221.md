# Question

A DFS tree is a spanning tree.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

When DFS is run on a connected undirected graph starting from any vertex, the tree edges form a spanning tree. The DFS visits every vertex exactly once and uses $n-1$ edges to connect all $n$ vertices, which is the definition of a spanning tree.
