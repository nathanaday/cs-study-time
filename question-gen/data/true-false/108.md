# Question

A greedy algorithm builds a solution step by step, making the locally optimal choice at each step, and never revises past decisions.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is the defining characteristic of greedy algorithms. Unlike dynamic programming (which considers subproblems) or backtracking (which undoes decisions), a greedy algorithm commits to each choice permanently. When a greedy approach works, it implies something structural about the problem that makes local decisions globally optimal.
