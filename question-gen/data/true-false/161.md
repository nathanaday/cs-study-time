# Question

Suppose we are given an instance of the Minimum Spanning Tree problem on a graph $G$ where all edge costs are distinct. Let $T$ be a minimum spanning tree for this instance. Now suppose we replace each edge cost $c_e$ by its square $c_e^2$, creating a new instance with the same graph but different costs. $T$ is still a MST for this new instance.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

If there are negative-cost edges in $G$, squaring makes them positive, which can change the relative ordering of edge weights. For example, consider edges with costs $-3$, $1$, $2$. The original order is $-3 < 1 < 2$, but after squaring: $9, 1, 4$, giving order $1 < 4 < 9$. The edge that was cheapest ($-3$) becomes the most expensive ($9$). So Kruskal's algorithm would pick edges in a different order, potentially producing a different MST.
