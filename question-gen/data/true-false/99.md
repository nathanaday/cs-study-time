# Question

In the scheduling to minimize lateness problem, each request $i$ has a fixed deadline $d_i$ and a required time duration $t_i$, and the goal is to minimize the maximum lateness $L = \max_i \: l_i$ across all requests.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

The lateness of request $i$ is $l_i = f(i) - d_i$ if $f(i) > d_i$, and $l_i = 0$ otherwise. We want to arrange all jobs so that the single worst lateness penalty (the maximum lateness) is as small as possible.
