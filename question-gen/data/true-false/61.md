# Question

The time complexity of BFS on a directed graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges is $O(m+n)$, the same as BFS on an undirected graph.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

BFS works almost identically in directed graphs, with the only difference being that edges are followed only in their forward direction. The algorithm still explores nodes layer by layer and processes each node and edge at most once, maintaining $O(m+n)$ time complexity.
