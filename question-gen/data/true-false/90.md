# Question

In the Gale-Shapley algorithm (with men proposing), the sequence of women to whom a man proposes gets worse and worse in terms of his preference list.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By statement (1.2), a man proposes to women in decreasing order of his preference. He starts by proposing to his top choice. If rejected, he proposes to his next choice, and so on. He never proposes to the same woman twice.
