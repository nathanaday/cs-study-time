# Question

Given a directed graph with positive, distinct edge costs and shortest $s$-$t$ path $P$, if we replace each cost $c_e$ by $c_e^2$, then $P$ must still be a shortest $s$-$t$ path.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Squaring penalizes unbalanced costs. Consider: $s \to v$ cost 1, $v \to t$ cost 99 (total 100); $s \to w$ cost 51, $w \to t$ cost 50 (total 101). Original shortest: $s \to v \to t$ (100). After squaring: $s \to v \to t$ costs $1 + 9801 = 9802$, while $s \to w \to t$ costs $2601 + 2500 = 5101$. The shortest path changes because squaring penalizes the highly unbalanced path (1, 99) more than the balanced one (51, 50).
