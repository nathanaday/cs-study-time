# Question

The sequence $\langle 23, 17, 14, 6, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12 \rangle$ is a valid max-heap.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

This is not a valid max-heap. At index 4, $A[4] = 6$, and its right child is $A[9] = 7$. Since $6 < 7$, the max-heap property $A[\text{PARENT}(i)] \ge A[i]$ is violated.
