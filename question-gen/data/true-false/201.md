# Question

The array [100, 93, 83, 90, 79, 84, 81] corresponds to a binary max-heap.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

In a max-heap, every parent must be greater than or equal to its children. Node at index 3 (value 90) is a child of node at index 1 (value 93), which is fine. But node at index 3 (value 90) has children at indices 6 (value 84) and 7 (value 81). Node at index 2 (value 83) has children at indices 4 (value 90) -- but 83 < 90, violating the max-heap property.
