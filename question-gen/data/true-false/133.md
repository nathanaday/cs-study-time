# Question

Given functions $f_1$ and $g_1$ such that $f_1(n) = O(g_1(n))$, it follows that $f_1(n)^2 = O(g_1(n)^2)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Since $f_1(n) \leq c_1 \cdot g_1(n)$ for some constant $c_1 > 0$ and sufficiently large $n$, squaring both sides gives $f_1(n)^2 \leq c_1^2 \cdot g_1(n)^2$. Therefore $f_1(n)^2 = O(g_1(n)^2)$.
