# Question

In any instance of interval partitioning, the number of resources needed is at least the depth of the set of intervals.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is statement (4.4). If $d$ intervals all overlap at a single point, they must each be assigned to a different resource. Therefore, no schedule can use fewer than $d$ resources, making the depth a lower bound on the optimal solution.
