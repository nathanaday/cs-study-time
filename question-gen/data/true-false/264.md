# Question

An array sorted in non-decreasing order is a valid min-heap.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

For any element at position $i$, its children are at positions $2i$ and $2i+1$. In a sorted (non-decreasing) array, $A[i] \le A[2i]$ and $A[i] \le A[2i+1]$, which satisfies the min-heap property. For example, $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ forms a valid min-heap.
