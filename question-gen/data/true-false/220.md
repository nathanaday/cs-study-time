# Question

Stable Matching: Suppose Jack prefers Rose to others, and Rose prefers Jack to others. The pair (Jack, Rose) exists in every stable matching.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If Jack and Rose are each other's top choice, they must be paired in every stable matching. If they were not paired, say Jack is with W and Rose is with M, then (Jack, Rose) would be a blocking pair since both prefer each other over their current partners. This contradicts stability.
