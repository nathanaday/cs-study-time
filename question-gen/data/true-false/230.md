# Question

Assume that no two men have the same highest-ranking woman. If the women carried out the proposal to men, then the Gale-Shapley algorithm will contain a matching set where every man gets their highest-ranking woman.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

When women propose, women get their best valid partners and men get their worst valid partners. The fact that no two men share the same top choice does not guarantee men get their top choice when women propose. Men's top choices may not be their valid partners.
