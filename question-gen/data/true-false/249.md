# Question

If a connected undirected graph $G(V, E)$ has $n = |V|$ vertices and $n + 10$ edges, we can find the minimum spanning tree of G in $O(n)$ runtime.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

With $n + 10$ edges and $n$ vertices, there are only 11 extra edges beyond a spanning tree. We can find a spanning tree in $O(n)$ time (e.g., via DFS). Then for each of the 11 extra edges, check if it improves the tree by finding the maximum weight edge on the cycle it creates. With only 11 extra edges, the total work is $O(n)$.
