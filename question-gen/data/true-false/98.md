# Question

In the greedy interval partitioning algorithm, an interval $I_j$ could be left unlabeled if too many preceding intervals overlap with it.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

If $t$ intervals precede $I_j$ in sorted order and overlap with it, then $t + 1$ intervals pass over the start time of $I_j$. Since the depth is $d$ and $t + 1 \leq d$, we have $t \leq d - 1$. At most $d - 1$ labels are excluded, and we have $d$ labels available, so there is always at least one label remaining for $I_j$.
