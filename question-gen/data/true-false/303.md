# Question

If $f(n) = O(g(n))$, then $\log_2 f(n) = O(\log_2 g(n))$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Let $f(n) = 2$ and $g(n) = 1$ for all $n$. Then $f(n) = O(g(n))$ with $c = 2$. But $\log_2 f(n) = 1$ and $\log_2 g(n) = 0$, so we would need $1 \le c \cdot 0$ for some constant $c$, which is impossible. The issue arises because the logarithm can map a constant-factor gap to an additive gap that cannot be absorbed when the base value is small.
