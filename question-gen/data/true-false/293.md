# Question

In the Gale-Shapley algorithm with men proposing, a woman can never improve her outcome by misrepresenting her preference list.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The Gale-Shapley algorithm is not strategy-proof for the non-proposing side. A woman can potentially improve her outcome by lying. For example, with $n=3$, a woman $w_1$ who truthfully gets her 2nd choice can misrepresent her list (e.g., ranking her true 2nd choice last) to trigger a cascade of proposals that results in her receiving her true 1st choice. The algorithm is only strategy-proof for the proposing side (men).
