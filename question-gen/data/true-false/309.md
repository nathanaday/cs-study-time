# Question

In an $n$-node undirected graph $G$ where $n$ is even, if every node has degree at least $n/2$, then $G$ must be connected.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If $G$ were disconnected, take two components $C$ and $C'$. Every node in $C$ has degree at least $n/2$, but its neighbors are all within $C$, so $|C| \ge n/2 + 1$. By the same argument, $|C'| \ge n/2 + 1$. Then $n \ge |C| + |C'| \ge n + 2$, a contradiction. Therefore $G$ must be connected.
