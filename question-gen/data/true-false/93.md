# Question

The set $S$ returned by the Gale-Shapley algorithm is guaranteed to be a stable matching.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By statement (1.6), the matching $S$ has no instabilities. The proof considers any potential blocking pair $(m, w')$ and shows that either $m$ never proposed to $w'$ (meaning he prefers his partner more) or $w'$ rejected $m$ in favor of someone she prefers at least as much. Either way, no instability can exist.
