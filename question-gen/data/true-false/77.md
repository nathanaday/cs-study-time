# Question

A spanning tree of a graph with $n$ vertices has exactly $n - 1$ edges.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Any tree on $n$ nodes has exactly $n - 1$ edges (statement 3.1). Since a spanning tree is a tree that includes all $n$ vertices, it must have $n - 1$ edges. This follows from the one-to-one correspondence between edges and non-root nodes when the tree is rooted.
