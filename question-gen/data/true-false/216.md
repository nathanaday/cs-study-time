# Question

Amortized cost of operations in a Fibonacci heap is at least as good as the worst case cost of those same operations in a binomial heap.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Fibonacci heaps were designed to improve on binomial heaps. Key operations like insert and decrease-key have $O(1)$ amortized cost in Fibonacci heaps (vs $O(\\log n)$ worst case in binomial heaps), and extract-min/delete have $O(\\log n)$ amortized cost in both. So Fibonacci heap amortized costs are at least as good as binomial heap worst-case costs.
