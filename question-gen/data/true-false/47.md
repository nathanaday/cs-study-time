# Question

Kruskal's and Prim's MST algorithms for undirected graphs can be directly applied to find minimum cost arborescences in directed graphs.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The directed nature breaks these simple greedy approaches. For example, the cheapest edge might enter the root (which violates the arborescence definition requiring no edges entering the root) or including it might force expensive choices later in the construction.
