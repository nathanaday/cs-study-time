# Question

Consider the stable matching problem with $n$ women and $n$ men (where $n \geq 2$). Suppose the preference lists are such that for any woman $w$, her most preferred man $m$ does not have $w$ as his first preference. The Gale-Shapley algorithm with men proposing can match every woman to her most preferred man.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Consider this example: W1: M1>M3>M2, W2: M2>M1>M3, W3: M3>M1>M2, M1: W2>W1>W3, M2: W1>W2>W3, M3: W1>W3>W2. Each woman's top man does not rank her first. Running GS with men proposing: M1 proposes to W2 (accepts), M2 proposes to W1 (accepts), M3 proposes to W1 (rejected), then W3 (accepts). Final matching: (M1,W2), (M2,W1), (M3,W3). All women end up with their most preferred partner.
