# Question

The iterative implementation of DFS uses a queue (FIFO) to determine the order in which nodes are processed.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

DFS uses a **stack** (LIFO -- last-in, first-out), which ensures the most recently discovered node is processed first, causing the algorithm to plunge deeper before backtracking. BFS is the algorithm that uses a queue (FIFO).
