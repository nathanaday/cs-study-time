# Question

In a topological ordering of a DAG, the first node in the ordering must have no incoming edges, and the last node must have no outgoing edges.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The first node must indeed have no incoming edges (otherwise something would need to come before it). However, the last node is not required to have no outgoing edges -- it simply has no nodes after it in the ordering that it points to. A DAG can have nodes with outgoing edges that appear last in a valid topological ordering.
