# Question

A graph can have multiple distinct minimum spanning trees.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If a graph has edges with duplicate weights, different spanning trees may achieve the same minimum total weight. For example, if two edges have the same weight and either could be included in a spanning tree without changing the total cost, then both choices yield valid MSTs.
