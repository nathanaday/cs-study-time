# Question

It is possible to have an instance of the Stable Matching problem in which two women have the same best valid partner.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

When women propose in the Gale-Shapley algorithm, each woman ends up with her best valid partner. If two women had the same best valid partner, only one could be matched to him in the women-proposing GS output, meaning the other would not receive her best valid partner -- contradicting the optimality property of the women-proposing algorithm. Therefore, each woman must have a unique best valid partner.
