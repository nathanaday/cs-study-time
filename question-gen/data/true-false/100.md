# Question

Scheduling jobs in order of increasing slack time $d_i - t_i$ (smallest slack first) always produces an optimal schedule that minimizes maximum lateness.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Ordering by slack time can fail. A short job with moderate slack can accumulate massive lateness if a long job with almost no slack is scheduled before it. The correct greedy rule sorts by **deadline** (earliest deadline first), ignoring slack time entirely.
