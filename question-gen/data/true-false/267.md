# Question

Calling MAX-HEAPIFY on a leaf node (where $i > \lfloor A.\text{heap-size}/2 \rfloor$) performs no swaps and terminates in $\Theta(1)$ time.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

When $i > \lfloor A.\text{heap-size}/2 \rfloor$, node $i$ is a leaf with no children. LEFT$(i) = 2i > A.\text{heap-size}$ and RIGHT$(i) = 2i+1 > A.\text{heap-size}$, so both bound checks fail. The variable "largest" stays equal to $i$, no swap occurs, and the procedure terminates in $\Theta(1)$.
