# Question

Amortized analysis assumes a probability distribution over inputs to compute the expected cost of an operation.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Amortized analysis is **not** probabilistic. It guarantees a bound on the average cost per operation over any worst-case sequence. This is different from average-case or expected-time analysis, which assume a distribution over inputs. Amortized bounds hold deterministically for all possible sequences.
