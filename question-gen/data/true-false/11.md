# Question

In a graph with $n = |V|$ nodes and $m = |E|$ edges, the adjacency list representation requires $O(n^2)$ space, the same as the adjacency matrix.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The adjacency list requires $O(m + n)$ space, while the adjacency matrix requires $O(n^2)$. For sparse graphs where $m \ll n^2$, the adjacency list is significantly more space-efficient.
