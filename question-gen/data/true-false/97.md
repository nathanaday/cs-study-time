# Question

A man $m$ is a valid partner of woman $w$ if $w$ ranks $m$ first on her preference list.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

A valid partner of $w$ is any man $m$ such that $(m, w)$ appears in some stable matching. This has nothing to do with being ranked first. A man ranked low on $w$'s list could still be a valid partner if the global structure of preferences produces a stable matching containing that pair.
