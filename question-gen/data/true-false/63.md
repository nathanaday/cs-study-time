# Question

A directed graph $G$ is strongly connected if and only if for every pair of nodes $u$ and $v$, there exists at least one path between them (in either direction).

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Strong connectivity requires paths in _both_ directions between every pair of nodes. Specifically, for all nodes $u$ and $v$, there must be a path from $u$ to $v$ _and_ a path from $v$ to $u$. Having a path in just one direction is insufficient.
