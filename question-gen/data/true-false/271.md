# Question

HEAPSORT runs in $O(n \lg n)$ time regardless of the initial ordering of the input array.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

BUILD-MAX-HEAP takes $O(n)$, and each of the $n-1$ calls to MAX-HEAPIFY takes $O(\lg n)$ in the worst case. Even if the input is already sorted (ascending or descending), HEAPSORT still performs $O(n \lg n)$ total work because the extract-and-heapify loop always runs $n-1$ times.
