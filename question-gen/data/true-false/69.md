# Question

In the minimum cost arborescence algorithm, for the naive greedy strategy to immediately give an optimal arborescence, the set $F^*$ (formed by choosing the cheapest edge entering each node) must contain no cycles.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If $F^*$ forms a valid arborescence (no cycles, one edge entering each non-root node), then it must be optimal because we've chosen the cheapest possible edge entering each node. The algorithm only needs to recurse when $F^*$ contains a cycle.
