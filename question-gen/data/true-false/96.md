# Question

Different executions of the Gale-Shapley algorithm (with men proposing) can produce different stable matchings depending on the order in which free men propose.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

By statement (1.7), every execution of the Gale-Shapley algorithm with men proposing results in the same matching $S^*$, regardless of the order in which free men are chosen to propose. The output is deterministic in the sense that the final matching is always the man-optimal stable matching.
