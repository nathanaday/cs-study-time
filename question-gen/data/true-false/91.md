# Question

If a man $m$ is free at some point during the execution of the Gale-Shapley algorithm, then there is a woman to whom he has not yet proposed.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By statement (1.4), if $m$ had already proposed to every woman, then by (1.1) each of the $n$ women would be engaged at that point, meaning $n$ men are engaged. But there are only $n$ men total, and $m$ is free -- a contradiction. So $m$ must have a woman left to propose to.
