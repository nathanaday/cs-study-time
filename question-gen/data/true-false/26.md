# Question

Every DAG contains at least one node with no incoming edges.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is statement (3.19). Proof by contrapositive: if every node has at least one incoming edge, we can start at any node and walk backward indefinitely. After $n+1$ steps, we must revisit some node (by pigeonhole principle), forming a cycle. So if $G$ is a DAG, at least one node must have no incoming edges.
