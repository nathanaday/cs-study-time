# Question

For any two nodes $s$ and $t$ in an undirected graph, their connected components are either identical or disjoint.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

If a path exists between $s$ and $t$, any node reachable from $s$ is also reachable from $t$ (via $s$), so the components are identical. If no path exists, no node can belong to both components, so they are disjoint.
