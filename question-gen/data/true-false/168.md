# Question

If an edge is not part of any MST of G, then it must be the maximum weight edge on some cycle in G.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By the cycle property of MSTs, if an edge is not in any MST, it must be the unique maximum weight edge on some cycle. If it were not the maximum weight edge on any cycle, it could potentially be included in some MST.
