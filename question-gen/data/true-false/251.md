# Question

An amortized cost of insertion into a binomial heap is constant.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

While a single insertion into a binomial heap may take $O(\\log n)$ in the worst case due to cascading merges of binomial trees, the amortized cost over a sequence of $n$ insertions is $O(1)$ per insertion. This is analogous to incrementing a binary counter where most increments only flip a few bits.
