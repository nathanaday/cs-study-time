# Question

In the interval partitioning problem, the goal is to schedule all intervals using the minimum number of resources, where no two overlapping intervals share the same resource.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Unlike basic interval scheduling (which maximizes the number of scheduled intervals on one resource), interval partitioning must schedule every interval. The optimization is over the number of resources (e.g., classrooms) used, and we want to minimize that number.
