# Question

For any connected graph $G$, the graph $H$ whose nodes are spanning trees of $G$ (with an edge between two trees if they differ by exactly one edge swap) is always connected.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Any two spanning trees $T, T'$ differing in $k$ edges can be connected by single-edge swaps. Pick $e \in T' \setminus T$; adding $e$ to $T$ creates a cycle containing some $e' \in T \setminus T'$. Swap $e$ for $e'$ to get $T_1$, which differs from $T'$ in $k-1$ edges. By induction, $T_1$ connects to $T'$, so $T$ connects to $T'$ in $H$.
