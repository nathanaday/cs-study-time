# Question

If an undirected graph $G$ on $n$ nodes is connected and has $n - 1$ edges, it must contain a cycle.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

By the characterization theorem (3.2), any two of the following imply the third: (i) $G$ is connected, (ii) $G$ has no cycle, (iii) $G$ has $n-1$ edges. Since $G$ is connected and has $n-1$ edges, the third property -- acyclicity -- follows. Such a graph is a tree.
