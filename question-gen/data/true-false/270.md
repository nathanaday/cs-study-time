# Question

BUILD-MAX-HEAP runs in $O(n \lg n)$ time, and this bound is tight.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

While $O(n \lg n)$ is a valid upper bound, it is not tight. BUILD-MAX-HEAP actually runs in $O(n)$ time. The tighter analysis observes that most nodes are near the bottom of the tree and have small heights. The sum $\sum_{h=0}^{\lfloor \lg n \rfloor} \lceil n/2^{h+1} \rceil \cdot O(h)$ evaluates to $O(n)$ using the identity $\sum_{h=0}^{\infty} h/2^h = 2$.
