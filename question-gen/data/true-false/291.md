# Question

In every instance of the Stable Matching Problem, there exists a stable matching containing a pair $(m, w)$ such that $m$ is ranked first on the preference list of $w$ and $w$ is ranked first on the preference list of $m$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

It is possible that no mutual first-choice pair exists at all. Consider $n=2$: $m_1$ ranks $w_1$ first but $w_1$ ranks $m_2$ first; $m_2$ ranks $w_2$ first but $w_2$ ranks $m_1$ first. No pair is a mutual first choice. Yet stable matchings exist (e.g., $\{(m_1,w_1),(m_2,w_2)\}$) -- they simply contain no mutual first-choice pair because none exists in the instance.
