# Question

The greedy rule of always selecting the available request with the fewest number of conflicts (incompatible requests) produces an optimal solution for the interval scheduling problem.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Although the fewest-conflicts rule is a reasonable heuristic and works on many examples, carefully constructed counterexamples show it can produce suboptimal solutions. The unique optimal solution in such counterexamples selects more intervals than the fewest-conflicts approach.
