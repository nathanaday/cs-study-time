# Question

Gale-Shapley algorithm is a greedy algorithm.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

The Gale-Shapley algorithm is greedy in nature: at each step, each free man proposes to his most preferred woman who hasn't rejected him yet (making a locally optimal choice). The algorithm makes irrevocable decisions -- once a woman accepts a proposal, she may trade up but never becomes unmatched.
