# Question

The correct greedy rule for interval scheduling selects the available request with the earliest finish time $f(i)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

By always selecting the request that finishes first, the algorithm frees up the resource as early as possible, leaving the maximum remaining time to accommodate additional requests. This rule is proven to produce an optimal (maximum-size) compatible set.
