# Question

In any binary tree, the number of nodes with exactly two children equals the number of leaves minus one.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Proof by induction on $n$. Base: a single node has 1 leaf and 0 full nodes ($0 = 1-1$). Inductive step: if the root has one child, the subtree has the same counts. If the root has two children with subtrees having $L_1, L_2$ leaves and $F_1 = L_1-1$, $F_2 = L_2-1$ full nodes, then $F = F_1 + F_2 + 1 = (L_1-1)+(L_2-1)+1 = L_1+L_2-1 = L-1$.
