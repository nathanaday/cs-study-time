# Question

In the accounting method, each operation is assigned an amortized cost (charge) that may differ from its actual cost. When the charge exceeds the actual cost, the surplus is stored as credit for future expensive operations.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

The accounting method works like a prepaid account. Cheap operations are overcharged, and the excess is banked as credit. When an expensive operation occurs, stored credit is spent to cover the difference. The critical invariant is that total credit must never go negative -- the total charges must always be at least the total actual costs at every point in the sequence.
