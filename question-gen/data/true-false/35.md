# Question

The optimized topological ordering algorithm achieves $O(m+n)$ time complexity by maintaining for each node a count of its incoming edges from active nodes and a set of all nodes with zero active incoming edges.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

The optimization processes each edge exactly once across the entire algorithm. When a node $v$ is removed, we decrement the incoming edge count for each neighbor $w$ that $v$ pointed to. If $w$'s count reaches zero, we add it to the set of available nodes. This eliminates the need to rescan all nodes each iteration, achieving $O(m+n)$ time.
