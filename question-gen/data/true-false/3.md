# Question

In aggregate analysis, the total cost of $n$ operations is computed, and the amortized cost per operation is the total cost divided by $n$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Aggregate analysis is the simplest amortized technique. You analyze the entire sequence of $n$ operations together, compute the worst-case total cost $T(n)$, and then assign each operation an amortized cost of $T(n)/n$.
