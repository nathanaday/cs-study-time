# Question

An undirected graph G has no cycles, and is not a connected graph. Then, G must be a bipartite graph.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

An acyclic undirected graph (connected or not) is a forest. Every tree is bipartite (you can 2-color by alternating colors at each level). A forest is a collection of trees, each of which is bipartite, so the entire forest is bipartite.
