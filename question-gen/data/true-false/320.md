# Question

Every minimum-bottleneck spanning tree is a minimum spanning tree.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

A minimum-bottleneck spanning tree minimizes the maximum-cost edge. Consider four nodes $a,b,c,d$ with edges $(a,b)=1$, $(b,c)=2$, $(a,c)=2.5$, $(c,d)=3$. The MST is $\{(a,b),(b,c),(c,d)\}$ with total cost 6 and bottleneck 3. The tree $\{(a,b),(a,c),(c,d)\}$ has total cost 6.5 and bottleneck 3. Both achieve the minimum bottleneck of 3, but the second tree is not the MST (higher total cost). So a minimum-bottleneck tree need not be an MST.
