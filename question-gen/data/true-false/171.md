# Question

We know that algorithm A has a worst-case running time of $O(n \log(n))$ and algorithm B has a worst-case running time of $O(n^2)$. It is possible for algorithm B to run faster than algorithm A on an input size $n$ which is arbitrarily large.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Big-O notation describes an upper bound on the worst case. Algorithm A could have a best case much worse than its worst case, or the $O(n \log n)$ bound may not be tight. Algorithm B could run much faster than its worst case on many inputs. So for arbitrarily large $n$, there can exist inputs where B is faster than A.
