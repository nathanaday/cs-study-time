# Question

Every graph containing a triangle (3-cycle) cannot be bipartite.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

A triangle is an odd cycle of length 3. If we try to 2-color a triangle starting with one node as red, the next must be blue, and the third node is adjacent to both, so neither color works. More generally, any graph containing an odd cycle cannot be bipartite.
