# Question

A spanning tree of an unweighted graph has a designated root node.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

A spanning tree is simply a connected, acyclic subgraph that includes all vertices. By default, there is no designated root. However, we can choose to **root** a spanning tree at any node, which imposes a parent-child hierarchy. BFS and DFS naturally produce rooted spanning trees because they start from a specific source node.
