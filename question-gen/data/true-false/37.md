# Question

In the iterative DFS implementation, nodes are marked as "Explored" the moment they are first added to the stack, just as BFS marks nodes as "Discovered" when first encountered.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

This is a subtle but important difference. In BFS, nodes are marked "Discovered" immediately when first seen. In iterative DFS, nodes are marked "Explored" only when they are **popped from the stack and processed** (their edges are scanned). A node may sit in the stack for a while before being explored.
