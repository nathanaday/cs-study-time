# Question

Amortized analysis determines the average cost per operation over a worst-case sequence of $n$ operations, rather than analyzing the worst case of a single operation in isolation.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

The key distinction is "worst-case sequence." Amortized analysis does not assume a probabilistic distribution over inputs (that would be average-case analysis). Instead, it considers any possible sequence of operations and shows that the average cost per operation across that sequence is bounded, even if individual operations are occasionally expensive.
