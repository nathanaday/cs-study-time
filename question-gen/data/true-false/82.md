# Question

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is only meaningful for weighted graphs, since it minimizes the total edge weight among all spanning trees.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Without edge weights, all spanning trees of a graph have the same number of edges ($n - 1$), so there is nothing to optimize. The MST problem asks: among all spanning trees, which one has the smallest sum of edge weights? This question only makes sense when edges carry weights.
