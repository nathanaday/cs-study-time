# Question

A binary heap is always a complete binary tree.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

A binary heap is a nearly complete (or almost complete) binary tree: all levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right. In a strictly complete binary tree, every level is fully filled. Since the last level of a binary heap may not be full, it is not always a complete binary tree in the strict sense.
