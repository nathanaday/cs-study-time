# Question

In a dynamic array that doubles its capacity when full, the amortized cost per push operation is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the current number of elements.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The amortized cost per push is $O(1)$. Most pushes cost $O(1)$ for the insertion itself. The occasional doubling copies all $n$ elements in $O(n)$ time, but this happens infrequently enough that the cost is spread across many cheap pushes. Using the accounting method, charging 3 units per push (1 for insertion, 2 saved as credit) provides enough credit to pay for the copying when doubling occurs.
