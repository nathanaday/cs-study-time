# Question

In MAX-HEAP-INSERT, the new element's key is initially set to $-\infty$ so that HEAP-INCREASE-KEY is guaranteed to succeed without triggering an error.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

HEAP-INCREASE-KEY checks that the new key is at least as large as the current key, raising an error otherwise. By initializing the new element to $-\infty$, any finite key value passed to HEAP-INCREASE-KEY will satisfy this check. This provides a safe sentinel value that is guaranteed to be replaced.
