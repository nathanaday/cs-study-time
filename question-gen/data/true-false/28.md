# Question

A directed graph $G$ is a DAG if and only if $G$ has a topological ordering.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Statement (3.18) proves one direction: topological ordering implies DAG. Statement (3.20) proves the converse: DAG implies topological ordering (by induction: repeatedly remove a node with no incoming edges and order it next). These two statements establish equivalence.
