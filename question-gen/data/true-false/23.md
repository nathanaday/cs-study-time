# Question

BFS can determine whether a path exists from node $s$ to node $t$ in a graph, but it does not guarantee finding the shortest such path.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

BFS both determines path existence and finds the shortest path. Since each layer $L_j$ contains exactly the nodes at distance $j$ from $s$ (theorem 3.3), the first time BFS discovers $t$, it has found a shortest $s$-$t$ path.
