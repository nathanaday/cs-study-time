# Question

Consider six people (Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Bilbo, Gollum) who want to pair up into three pairs. Each has strict preferences over the others, and a matching is stable if no two unpaired people prefer each other over their current partners. Given that Gollum is ranked last by everyone else and every other person has a unique most-preferred partner, a stable matching exists for these preferences.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Since Gollum is least preferred by everyone, whoever is matched with Gollum (call them A) would prefer anyone else. Among the remaining people, there must be someone B who prefers A the most (since every non-Gollum person appears as someone's first preference). If B is paired with C (not A), then A prefers B over Gollum, and B prefers A over C, creating an instability. This argument applies to every possible matching, so no stable matching exists.
