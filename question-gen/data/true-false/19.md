# Question

In a BFS tree $T$ rooted at $s$, if $(x, y)$ is an edge in the original graph $G$ with $x$ in layer $L_i$ and $y$ in layer $L_j$, then $|i - j|$ can be as large as 2.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

By theorem (3.4), $i$ and $j$ differ by at most 1. When BFS processes node $x$ in layer $L_i$, any undiscovered neighbor would be placed in $L_{i+1}$. So no edge in $G$ can connect nodes whose layers differ by more than 1 -- there are never "shortcuts" that skip layers.
