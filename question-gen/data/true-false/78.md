# Question

For a given connected graph $G$, there is exactly one spanning tree.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

A connected graph can have many different spanning trees. Any connected subgraph of $G$ that includes all vertices and has exactly $n - 1$ edges (making it acyclic) is a valid spanning tree. Different choices of which edges to include yield different spanning trees.
