# Question

Given functions $f_1$ and $g_1$ such that $f_1(n) = O(g_1(n))$, it follows that $\log f_1(n) = O(\log g_1(n))$.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Counterexample: Let $f_1(n) = 2$ and $g_1(n) = 1$. Then $f_1(n) = O(g_1(n))$ holds (with constant $c = 2$). But $\log f_1(n) = 1$ and $\log g_1(n) = 0$, so $\log f_1(n) / \log g_1(n)$ is undefined (division by zero). There is no constant $c$ such that $1 \leq c \cdot 0$, so $\log f_1(n) = O(\log g_1(n))$ does not hold.
