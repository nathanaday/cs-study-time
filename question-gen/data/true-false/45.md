# Question

The BFS-based algorithm for testing bipartiteness assigns colors to nodes based on their layer number: even-numbered layers receive one color and odd-numbered layers receive the other color.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Starting from node $s$ in layer $L_0$ (colored red), BFS discovers neighbors layer by layer. Layer $L_1$ gets blue, $L_2$ gets red, and so on. Since BFS guarantees that edges only connect nodes in the same layer or adjacent layers, this coloring scheme ensures that edges between adjacent layers have opposite-colored endpoints.
