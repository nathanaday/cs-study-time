# Question

For a given set of preference lists, there can be at most one stable matching.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

There can be multiple distinct stable matchings for the same set of preference lists. Different algorithms or different execution orders can produce different stable matchings. The Gale-Shapley algorithm always produces one specific stable matching ($S^*$), but others may exist.
