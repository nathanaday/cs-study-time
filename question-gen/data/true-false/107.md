# Question

A schedule produced by the earliest deadline first rule can contain inversions.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

The earliest deadline first rule sorts jobs in order of increasing deadlines and schedules them in that order. By construction, no job with a later deadline is ever placed before a job with an earlier deadline, so the resulting schedule has zero inversions.
