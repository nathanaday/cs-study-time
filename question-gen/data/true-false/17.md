# Question

In BFS on an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ starting from node $s$, every node in layer $L_j$ is at distance exactly $j$ from $s$, where distance is the minimum number of edges in any $s$-to-node path.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

This is theorem (3.3). BFS radiates outward uniformly from $s$, so the first time it reaches a node, it has taken the shortest possible route. Layer $L_0 = \{s\}$, layer $L_1$ contains all neighbors of $s$ (distance 1), and so on.
