# Question

The naive topological ordering algorithm that repeatedly finds and removes a node with no incoming edges runs in $O(n^2)$ time.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Each iteration requires scanning all nodes to find one with no incoming edges, which takes $O(n)$ time. We perform $n$ iterations (one per node), giving $O(n^2)$ total time. This can be optimized to $O(m+n)$ by maintaining a count of active incoming edges for each node and a set of nodes with zero incoming edges.
