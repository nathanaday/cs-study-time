# Question

Let T be a complete binary tree with $n$ nodes. Finding a path from the root of T to a given vertex $v \in T$ using breadth-first search takes $O(\log n)$ time.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

BFS explores all nodes level by level. To find a path to vertex $v$, BFS may need to explore all nodes at each level before reaching $v$. In the worst case, BFS visits $O(n)$ nodes before finding $v$, not $O(\\log n)$.
