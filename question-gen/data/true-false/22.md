# Question

BFS on a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n = |V|$ nodes and $m = |E|$ edges, given in adjacency list representation, runs in $O(n^2)$ time.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

BFS runs in $O(m + n)$ time. The work at each node $u$ is proportional to its degree $n_u$, and $\sum_{u \in V} n_u = 2m$. Adding $O(n)$ for initialization gives $O(m + n)$. This is much better than $O(n^2)$ for sparse graphs where $m \ll n^2$.
