# Question

Consider the stable matching problem with $n$ women and $n$ men (where $n \geq 2$). It is not possible, for any preference lists, that the Gale-Shapley algorithm with men proposing matches every woman to her least preferred man.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

If every man's first preference in women is unique and for that particular woman the corresponding man is her least preferred, then each man proposes to his unique top choice first, she accepts (having no current partner), and no rejections occur. Every woman ends up matched with her least preferred man. For example with $n = 2$: M1: W1>W2, M2: W2>W1, W1: M2>M1, W2: M1>M2. M1 proposes to W1 (accepts), M2 proposes to W2 (accepts). Each woman gets her least preferred man.
