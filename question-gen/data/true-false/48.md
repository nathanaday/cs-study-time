# Question

In the BFS layer structure of a graph $G$, if there exists an edge connecting two nodes in the same layer $L_j$, then $G$ must contain an odd-length cycle.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Let the edge be $(x, y)$ where both $x, y \in L_j$. Let $z$ be their lowest common ancestor in the BFS tree at layer $L_i$ (where $i < j$). The cycle formed by the path from $z$ to $x$ (length $j-i$), edge $(x,y)$ (length $1$), and path from $y$ back to $z$ (length $j-i$) has total length $2(j-i) + 1$, which is always odd.
