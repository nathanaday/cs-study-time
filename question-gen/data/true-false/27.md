# Question

For a connected graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n = |V|$ nodes and $m = |E|$ edges, the BFS time complexity $O(m + n)$ simplifies to $O(m)$.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

In any connected graph, $m \geq n - 1$ (since a tree on $n$ nodes has $n - 1$ edges and is the sparsest connected graph). Therefore $n = O(m)$, and $O(m + n) = O(m)$.
