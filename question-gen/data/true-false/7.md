# Question

Aggregate analysis and the accounting method always yield the same amortized cost bound for a given data structure.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

Both methods are different perspectives on the same underlying idea: spreading the cost of expensive operations across many cheap ones. They must agree on the amortized bound, since they both compute the true average cost per operation over the worst-case sequence. The choice between them is a matter of proof convenience, not a difference in results.
