# Question

It is possible to have an instance of the Stable Matching problem in which two women have the same best valid partner.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

When women propose in the Gale-Shapley algorithm, they end up with their best valid partner. Thus, there needs to be a unique best valid partner for each woman. If two women had the same best valid partner, one would not end up with that partner in the matching obtained by Gale-Shapley with women proposing, which is a contradiction.
