# Question

Greedy algorithms make decisions to guarantee global optimization at each step.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, but they do not guarantee global optimization. Greedy choices are made based on what looks best at the moment without considering the overall problem.
