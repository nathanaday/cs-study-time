# Question

The greedy rule of always selecting the available request with the shortest interval $f(i) - s(i)$ produces an optimal solution for the interval scheduling problem.

# Answer

False

# Explanation

Selecting the shortest interval can also be suboptimal. A short interval placed in the middle of the timeline can block two other intervals that together form an optimal solution. Being short does not guarantee being a good choice.
