# Question

A schedule on $n$ jobs can have at most $\binom{n}{2}$ inversions.

# Answer

True

# Explanation

An inversion is a pair of jobs out of the greedy order. Since there are $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ pairs of jobs total, this is the maximum number of inversions (occurring when every pair is inverted, i.e., the schedule is in the exact reverse of the greedy order). Each swap fixes at least one inversion, guaranteeing the process terminates.
