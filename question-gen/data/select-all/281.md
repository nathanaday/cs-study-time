# Question

Which of the following statements about HEAPSORT are true?

# Choices

## a

HEAPSORT sorts in place, using only $O(1)$ additional memory.

**Answer:** True

## b

The best-case running time of HEAPSORT on an array of distinct elements is $\Omega(n \lg n)$.

**Answer:** True

## c

HEAPSORT is a stable sorting algorithm.

**Answer:** False

## d

BUILD-MAX-HEAP accounts for the dominant term in HEAPSORT's running time.

**Answer:** False

# Explanation

HEAPSORT sorts in place by swapping elements within the array, using $O(1)$ extra space. Even in the best case with distinct elements, HEAPSORT takes $\Omega(n \lg n)$ because each extraction requires restoring the heap. HEAPSORT is not stable -- equal elements may be reordered during the swap-and-heapify process. BUILD-MAX-HEAP runs in $O(n)$, but the $n-1$ calls to MAX-HEAPIFY during extraction dominate at $O(n \lg n)$.
