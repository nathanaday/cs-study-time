# Question

Which of the following are true properties of the Gale-Shapley algorithm?

# Choices

## a

The algorithm terminates after at most $n^2$ iterations of the main loop.

**Answer:** True

## b

The algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing side (men cannot benefit from lying).

**Answer:** True

## c

The algorithm always produces the same stable matching regardless of which free man proposes in each round.

**Answer:** True

## d

The resulting matching is simultaneously optimal for both the proposing and non-proposing sides.

**Answer:** False

# Explanation

The algorithm terminates in at most $n^2$ iterations because each man proposes to each woman at most once. It is strategy-proof for proposers and always produces the same (man-optimal) matching regardless of proposal order. However, the man-optimal matching is simultaneously the woman-pessimal matching -- it is optimal for proposers but worst-possible for the receiving side among all stable matchings.
