# Question

Which of the following greedy scheduling rules are correct for the stated objectives?

# Choices

## a

To minimize the number of base stations covering houses within distance 4: place each station at position $h_i + 4$ where $h_i$ is the leftmost uncovered house.

**Answer:** True

## b

To minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$: schedule jobs in decreasing order of $w_i / t_i$.

**Answer:** True

## c

To minimize triathlon completion time: sort contestants by increasing swim time $s_i$.

**Answer:** False

## d

For $n$ jobs each needing $p_i$ seconds on a supercomputer then $f_i$ seconds on a PC: schedule in decreasing order of $f_i$.

**Answer:** True

# Explanation

Base station placement uses a rightmost-possible greedy strategy. Weighted completion time uses the Smith's rule ratio $w_i/t_i$. Triathlon scheduling sorts by decreasing $b_i + r_i$ (post-swim time), not swim time -- swim time alone doesn't determine the bottleneck. Supercomputer scheduling sends jobs with the longest PC phase first, so their parallel work overlaps maximally.
