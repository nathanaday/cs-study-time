# Question

If you insert the values [12, 5, 13, 2, 5, 3, 7, 11, 18, 1, 9] into an empty binomial heap, which of the following statements are correct?

# Choices

## a

The number of binomial trees in this binomial heap is 3

**Answer:** True

## b

The number of binomial trees in this binomial heap is 4

**Answer:** False

## c

The highest order of a binomial tree in this binomial heap is 3

**Answer:** True

## d

The highest order of a binomial tree in this binomial heap is 4

**Answer:** False

# Explanation

After inserting 11 elements, the binomial heap has $n=11$ elements. In binary, $11 = 1011_2$, so the heap contains binomial trees $B_3$, $B_1$, and $B_0$ -- that is 3 trees. The highest order tree is $B_3$ (order 3).
