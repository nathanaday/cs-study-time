# Question

Which of the following statements about binary min-heaps is incorrect?

# Choices

## a

They are always complete binary trees

**Answer:** False

## b

Every parent node's key value is always less than its child nodes' key values

**Answer:** True

## c

They can be used to implement priority queues

**Answer:** False

## d

Merging two heaps of size n takes O(log n) worst-case time

**Answer:** True

## e

DECREASE-KEY takes O(1) amortized time

**Answer:** True

# Explanation

Statement (b) is incorrect because a parent's key should be less than or equal to (not strictly less than) its children's keys. Statement (d) is incorrect because merging two binary heaps takes O(n) time, not O(log n). Statement (e) is incorrect because DECREASE-KEY in a binary heap takes O(log n) worst-case and amortized time (O(1) amortized is for Fibonacci heaps).
