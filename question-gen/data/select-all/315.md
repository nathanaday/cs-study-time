# Question

You have data about $n$ deceased people with facts of two types: "$P_i$ died before $P_j$ was born" (non-overlapping) and "life spans of $P_i$ and $P_j$ overlapped." Which of the following correctly describe an algorithm to check consistency?

# Choices

## a

Build a directed graph with edges for 'died before born' facts and check for cycles using topological sort.

**Answer:** True

## b

For each 'overlap' pair $(P_i, P_j)$, verify there is no directed path between them in the 'died before born' graph.

**Answer:** True

## c

The facts are consistent if and only if the 'died before born' graph is a DAG.

**Answer:** False

## d

Overlap constraints can be ignored once the ordering constraints are verified acyclic.

**Answer:** False

# Explanation

The 'died before born' edges must form a DAG (no cycles), but that alone is insufficient. For each 'overlap' pair $(P_i, P_j)$, we must also verify that $P_i$ and $P_j$ are not ordered by the 'died before born' relation (no directed path between them), since overlapping life spans contradict one person dying before the other was born. Both conditions are necessary.
