# Question

Which of the following are true about minimum spanning trees?

# Choices

## a

The Cut Property states that the cheapest edge crossing any cut must be in every MST (when costs are distinct).

**Answer:** True

## b

The Cycle Property states that the most expensive edge on any cycle cannot be in any MST (when costs are distinct).

**Answer:** True

## c

Adding a new edge to a graph can only decrease or maintain the MST cost, never increase it.

**Answer:** True

## d

Kruskal's algorithm processes edges in decreasing order of cost.

**Answer:** False

# Explanation

The Cut Property and Cycle Property are the two fundamental MST properties (both require distinct costs for the strong 'every/no MST' versions). Adding a new edge can only help the MST (it either replaces a more expensive edge or is ignored). Kruskal's processes edges in increasing (not decreasing) order of cost, greedily adding edges that don't create cycles.
