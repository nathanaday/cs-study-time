# Question

Which of the following is true for asymptotic notations?

# Choices

## a

The worst-case time complexity of Merge sort is $\Omega(\log n)$

**Answer:** True

## b

If $f(n) = n \log(n^8)$ and $g(n) = \log n^n$ then $f(n) = O(g(n))$

**Answer:** True

## c

If $f(n) = o(g(n))$, then $g(n) = \Omega(f(n))$

**Answer:** True

## d

If $f(n) = O(n^2)$ and $g(n) = O(n^2)$, then $f(n)/g(n) = O(1)$

**Answer:** False

# Explanation

(A) True: Merge sort's worst case is $\\Theta(n \\log n)$, which is $\\Omega(\\log n)$. (B) True: $f(n) = 8n\\log n$ and $g(n) = n\\log n$, so $f(n) = O(g(n))$. (C) True: If $f(n) = o(g(n))$ then $g(n)$ grows strictly faster, so $g(n) = \\Omega(f(n))$. (D) False: If $f(n) = n^2$ and $g(n) = n$, both are $O(n^2)$, but $f(n)/g(n) = n$ which is not $O(1)$.
