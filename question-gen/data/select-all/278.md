# Question

Which of the following are true about the leaves of a heap stored in an array $A[1 \ldots n]$?

# Choices

## a

The leaves occupy indices $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 1$ through $n$.

**Answer:** True

## b

A node $i$ is a leaf if and only if $2i > n$.

**Answer:** True

## c

Approximately half the nodes in a heap are leaves.

**Answer:** True

## d

The leaves of a max-heap are always sorted in non-decreasing order from left to right.

**Answer:** False

# Explanation

Leaves are nodes with no children. The left child of node $i$ is $2i$, so $i$ is a leaf iff $2i > n$, i.e., $i > n/2$, i.e., $i \ge \lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 1$. This means roughly half the nodes are leaves. However, the heap property imposes no ordering among siblings or among leaves generally, so leaves need not be sorted.
