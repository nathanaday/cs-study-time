# Question

Which of the following algorithms use the divide and conquer approach?

# Choices

## a

Heap Sort

**Answer:** False

## b

Merge Sort

**Answer:** True

## c

Prim's Algorithm

**Answer:** False

## d

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Answer:** False

# Explanation

Merge Sort uses divide and conquer: it divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each, and merges. Heap Sort uses a heap data structure (not D&C). Prim's is a greedy MST algorithm. BFS is a graph traversal algorithm.
