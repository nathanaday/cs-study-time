# Question

Consider a graph $G$ with edges labeled $X$ or $Y$. You want a spanning tree with exactly $k$ edges labeled $X$. Which of the following are true?

# Choices

## a

The set of achievable values of $k$ across all spanning trees forms a contiguous range $[k_{\min}, k_{\max}]$.

**Answer:** True

## b

Starting from any spanning tree, you can increase the $X$-count by one by swapping a non-tree $X$-edge for a tree $Y$-edge on the resulting cycle.

**Answer:** True

## c

Finding such a tree requires solving an NP-hard problem in general.

**Answer:** False

## d

The algorithm runs in polynomial time by performing at most $n$ edge swaps from any initial spanning tree.

**Answer:** True

# Explanation

By matroid theory, the achievable $X$-edge counts form a contiguous range. Starting from any spanning tree, each swap (adding a non-tree edge and removing a tree edge on the created cycle) can change the $X$-count by one, provided the cycle contains an edge of the opposite label. At most $n$ swaps suffice. This is solvable in $O(n^2)$ time, not NP-hard.
