# Question

Which of the following are valid properties of a $d$-ary heap with $n$ elements?

# Choices

## a

The height is $\Theta(\log_d n)$.

**Answer:** True

## b

The $j$-th child of node $i$ is at index $d(i-1) + j + 1$.

**Answer:** True

## c

INCREASE-KEY runs in $O(\log_d n)$ time.

**Answer:** True

## d

EXTRACT-MAX runs in $O(\log_d n)$ time.

**Answer:** False

# Explanation

A $d$-ary heap has height $\Theta(\log_d n)$ and the $j$-th child of node $i$ is at index $d(i-1) + j + 1$. INCREASE-KEY bubbles up, comparing with one parent per level, giving $O(\log_d n)$. However, EXTRACT-MAX must compare with all $d$ children at each level as it sinks down, so its time is $O(d \log_d n)$, not $O(\log_d n)$.
