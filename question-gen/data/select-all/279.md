# Question

Which of the following are necessary preconditions for MAX-HEAPIFY$(A, i)$ to correctly restore the max-heap property?

# Choices

## a

The subtrees rooted at LEFT$(i)$ and RIGHT$(i)$ are already valid max-heaps.

**Answer:** True

## b

Node $i$ must not be a leaf.

**Answer:** False

## c

$A[i]$ must be smaller than at least one of its children.

**Answer:** False

## d

The entire array $A[1 \ldots A.\text{heap-size}]$ must already satisfy the max-heap property except possibly at node $i$.

**Answer:** True

# Explanation

MAX-HEAPIFY assumes that the left and right subtrees of node $i$ are already valid max-heaps -- this is the key precondition. It is valid to call MAX-HEAPIFY on a leaf (it simply does nothing in $\Theta(1)$), so (b) is not required. Similarly, $A[i]$ does not need to be smaller than a child -- if it is already larger, MAX-HEAPIFY terminates without changes, which is correct behavior.
