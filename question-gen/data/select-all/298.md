# Question

An algorithm has running time $T(n) = 2^n$. Which of the following correctly describe the effect of changing the input size?

# Choices

## a

Doubling $n$ squares the running time: $T(2n) = (T(n))^2$.

**Answer:** True

## b

Increasing $n$ by 1 doubles the running time: $T(n+1) = 2 \cdot T(n)$.

**Answer:** True

## c

Doubling $n$ doubles the running time: $T(2n) = 2 \cdot T(n)$.

**Answer:** False

## d

Increasing $n$ by 1 increases the running time by an additive constant.

**Answer:** False

# Explanation

For $T(n) = 2^n$: $T(2n) = 2^{2n} = (2^n)^2 = (T(n))^2$, so doubling the input squares the time. $T(n+1) = 2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^n = 2 \cdot T(n)$, so adding one element doubles the time. This is a key reason exponential algorithms are impractical.
