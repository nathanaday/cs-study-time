# Question

Which of the following correctly describe how to implement a FIFO queue and a LIFO stack using a priority queue?

# Choices

## a

FIFO queue: use a min-priority queue where each inserted element receives an increasing timestamp as its key.

**Answer:** True

## b

FIFO queue: use a max-priority queue where each inserted element receives an increasing timestamp as its key.

**Answer:** False

## c

LIFO stack: use a max-priority queue where each inserted element receives an increasing timestamp as its key.

**Answer:** True

## d

Both FIFO and LIFO operations take $O(\lg n)$ per operation when implemented with a priority queue.

**Answer:** True

# Explanation

For a FIFO queue, the oldest element should be dequeued first. Using a min-priority queue with increasing timestamps, EXTRACT-MIN returns the element with the smallest (oldest) timestamp. For a LIFO stack, the newest element should be popped first. Using a max-priority queue with increasing timestamps, EXTRACT-MAX returns the element with the largest (newest) timestamp. Both INSERT and EXTRACT operations on a heap take $O(\lg n)$.
